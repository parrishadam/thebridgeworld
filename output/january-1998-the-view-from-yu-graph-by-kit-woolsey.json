One nice feature of this perspective is that you get the ad-vantages of being a spectator, yet can openly discuss the deal as it is being played, gaining additional insights from the observations of others. Of course, the observations are based on seeing all four hands; most show who can see all four hands must take great care not to let knowledge of the layout affect his analysis or evaluation — the players' actions leave the players in their seats based on their information. This two-player follows the 20-board-final: USA-1 vs France. Paul Chemla was South and Michel Perron North."

One of turn because any player who isn't smart enough to know whose lead it is certainly isn't smart enough to make the best opening lead. Here, however, you surely don't want to accept if heart lead from partner. Well—you might as well hear up your queen.\n\nRon GCKRAD: \"e. Who needs this agita? suspense that a club lead would be better for declarer, so I don't want to bar a heart lead.\"\n\nJohn CARRUTHERS: \"e. Interesting twist. Partner should have a heart stopper, as I did not promise one. Still, I'll look pretty foolish if a heart is not only lead to beat it. It won't be for the first, or the last, time. (And just because I told you guys I'm pretty thick-skinned does not give you free rein to play hay me)!\"\n\nWe'll save our flayings for your coterie. Meanwhile: Speaking of comedy, STIVE WEINSTEIN: \"e. Seems like partner wants a heart lead. I think I want a heart lead—so let's make West lead a heart.\"\n\nBobby WOLFF: \"e. A great problem with a real guess by us, I'm hoping for ace-low, not king-low, in hearts from partner. The not allow, two-heart bidder may have a solid club suit, with dummy having sold spades.\"\n\nMax & Max HARDY: \"d. Why should we want a heart lead?\"\n\nBecause we have queen-third.\n\nPHILIP ALDER: \"d. Despite Goldwater's rule, I see this as a toss-up between e and d. I lean slightly toward the latter: I might even get a diamond lead. And, as Fast might have one entry, I would prefer that to be the first heart attack. John LOWENTHAL: \"d. Normally, I choose the 'penalty card' option when the situation is not clear, but here I think there is a real chance that West will try a diamond choice. If I bar the heart lead.\"\n\n**Chip MARTEL**: \"e. If I had to see how it is a real guess by us. I'm hoping for ace-low, not king-low, in hearts from partner.\"\n\nBobby WOLFF: \"e. A great problem with a real guess by us. I'm hoping for ace-low, not king-low, in hearts from partner. The not two-heart bidder may have a solid club suit, with dummy having sold spades.\"\n\nSolid clubs aren't likely, but we still see no reason to give the defense a chance to lead that suit. We know that chance to lead one, and probably two, heart stoppers, and positionally we think a heart lead from West is fine. A might have one entry; I would prefer that to be the first heart attack.\n\nCathy HUDDECIEC: \"c. I don't mind a heart lead knowing RHO has only low ones), 1 choose the 'penalty card' option when the prefer to have West lead the heart.\"\n\nClip MARTEL: \"e. If's hard to see how it can be better to have East lead hearts rather than the West. If I bar the heart lead...\"\n\nJOHN LOWENTHAL: \"Pass. Take a plus. John LOWENTHAL: \"Pass. Take a plus.

Rosenkranz you holding-queen of hearts were the three-notrump king-queen of hearts were the three-notrump dance.\n\nTwo hearts. marking time!

He can pattern out over two spades is that it is too committal as to strain, and just as easily.\n\nMARSHALL MILES: \"Two spades. Partner's most likely distribution is 3=4=1=5, but with five strong nottrumps without checking out the minors, the major shapes, but two nottrump is worth considering because partner might partner out on the way to game.\"\n\nHe can pattern out over two spades.

If he thought someone had messed up he said so, and explained why. This novel approach brought tournament descriptions up from the old boy network to the level of at least semi-responsible reporting; once Edgar had done it, others did also. The upheaval in bridge journalism began less than two years after \"New Science\" had begun to revolutionize table behavior. It was less dramatic, but its effects were equally long lasting."

I kept two of these \"Act of God\" columns, one for each team, and with all the results in, comparison would show if one team was substantially luckier than the other.\n\nThe final tabulation shows three types of notations in each player's column: charges for errors, credits for brilliance, and black marks for uncharged errors. The net figure is the player's total IMP charges, less IMP credits, plus (for I am a purist) a one-point charge for each black mark. This net figure, divided by the number of boards played, gives a fraction—actually, the number of IMP lost per board played—which, in my opinion, is a reliable index of general effectiveness.\n\nSince this article will take the form of analysis of each player's performance, it will, inevitably, deal more with personalities than is the custom in bridge reports. I make no apology for this. My team has not done well enough to give us a chance to play for the U.S. next year; I am not in a glass house, and so I can afford to throw stones. But it is only fair to emphasize the obvious: opportunities for brilliance are few; for error, countless. In addition to the few brilliancies and many errors reported here, each player made thousands of sound, accurate decisions which go unheralded because the right play or bid is unspectacular.\n\n**The Italians**\n\nI was, I admit, very much surprised by my final tabulation on the Italian"

In New York last year they played less than any of the others, and in Como they shared second billing with Chiaradia and D'Alelio. But they were clearly the best pair around this year.\n\nMy estimate is that fairly good play will lose one IMP every four boards. Par, then, is .250 (and it is not common to play well under the pressure of the World Championship match). So the record of Belladonna and Avarelli as a pair is truly remarkable.\n\nThere were very few charges against them. . . . Their system cost Belladonna and Avarelli a small loss on Deal 94 when they reached the wrong partial, but almost all of their infrequent bidding troubles seemed to arise after takeout doubles. . . . a fourth occurred on Deal 68:"

Three diamonds showed a minimum, so Nilsland terminated any further investigation.\n\nThe Swedes said afterwards that either West shouldn't open a non-opening bid or East shouldn't force to game. That's true, but many pairs would be in game at IMPs. Switch West's hearts and clubs and four spades is acceptable.\n\nThe Newcomers did well when Lars, West, despite his fitting king of diamonds, opted not to move over two spades. This ostensibly remarkable decision was based on real-world tactical considerations. With a fit, the Danes prefer not to pass out a passed-hand one-level response, fearing this would make entry into the auction too easy for the opponents. Thus, there was only the mildest of inferences that East did not have a rock-bottom minimum hand. (This is not to say that Lars' decision was right. It seems mighty conservative to me anyway.)\n\nBWS auction: pass — one diamond — one spade — pass.\n\nAwards: 3 ♠ 10; 2 NT 7; 3 NT 4; 4 ♠ 3."

When Fallenius couldn't bid three notrump, Nilsland was endplayed into four spades.\n\nFor the young Danes, Lars, West, began with a weak notrump. In North America, East would presumably have bid two notrump followed by three hearts, the lebensohl route with four spades and a heart stopper. Here, though, Morten made a negative double, then offered a choice of games, while promising a heart stopper.\n\nBWS auction: one diamond — (one heart) — double — two clubs — two hearts — two spades — three diamonds — three spades — four spades — pass.\n\nAwards: 4 ♠ 10; 5 ♦ 8; 3 ♠ 6; 4 ♦ 5; 2 NT 4; 3 NT 3."

Siniscalco did not give Forquet the club ruff he was angling for, but Becker had to lose a club anyway, for down 300. Since four spades was doubled and set 200 at the other table, the U. S. lost 500 points—six IMP.\n\nNow, I don't admire Becker's two-heart opening, but I have charged the whole loss to Crawford. The vagueness of the requirements for a weak two-bid and the liberties taken within even these hazy limits cause many a loss. But why here? It seems to me that Crawford should expect to beat four spades, perhaps a lot; and just as clearly he should expect five hearts to go down, no matter what sort of two-heart bid partner has. A decision like that five-heart bid can be justified only by success, and this one wasn't so justified.\n\n*\n\nIn general, Crawford's performance, especially in the first half of the match, was astonishing. Some of his errors were of the sort you just don't expect from one of the world's greatest players. . . . And on Deal 64, non-vulnerable against vulnerable, he held:\n\n♠ K 6  ♥ Q 4 2  ♦ K 7 6 4 3 2  ♣ J 7.\n\nOne club (artificial, strong) was opened at his left; pass from partner; two clubs (artificial, strong) at his right. \"Three diamonds,\" bid Crawford, undaunted by the minimum of 17 points at his left, and an ace and a king or three kings at his right. Down 1300. It's hard to believe.\n\nHowever, most of Crawford's charges are far more reasonable, . . . I have more sympathy for Crawford and"

Well, Fallenius is Swedish by birth, but now he lives primarily in New York City. They use a strong-club system with five-card majors, 14-16 notrump and a nebulous one diamond. When holding at least game-going values, they usually ascend into a relay auction.\n\nThe Newcomers are brothers Lars and Morten Lund Madsen. Both are students at Copenhagen University, Lars studying economics and Morten mathematics. They were the mainstays of the Danish team that won last year's World Junior Championship, and have had several medal-winning performances in European junior events. However, Lars, at 25, is too old for further success at that level. Morten, at 23, has two more years of eligibility. The Danes use an Acol-style system but with five-card one-spade openings. They employ a variable notrump (11-14 nonvul., 15-17 vul.) and, most unusually for Europeans, weak two-bids in three suits.\n\nOur thanks to these readers who sent deals used in this match: John Uchida, Seattle, Deal 2; Michael Whitman, San Francisco, Deal 3; Martin Miller, Rochester, NY, Deal 4; L.

Don't tell me about old dogs.\n\n*\n\nSilodor, on his record in Nationals over the past few years, is very likely the finest player in the U. S.

So it was disappointing and costly that he was not at the top of his usually magnificent game.\n\n*\n\n. . . I'm not sure that Silodor should double four spades, but I know he shouldn't save against it. In my view, to push the opponents into a contract and then sacrifice against it is one of the gravest bidding crimes.\n\nHowever, there was no actual swing on this hand. At the other table the auction went: . . . Just as Stone was about to pay the penalty for his rashness—the difference between a rash bid and a courageous one is a matter of result—Chiaradia came to his rescue . . .\n\n*\n\nAgainst Italy, Roth and Stone did not play except as partners (Roth played briefly with Crawford, but against Argentina), so it is convenient to treat their records jointly. They were, in general, an effective pair, tossing away a little more than their share of points, especially early in the match, but playing a very active style and earning back many points. Stone, particularly, created many favorable swings for the U.S.\n\nOn the whole the Roth-Stone System was less successful than Roth and Stone were as individuals. Unluckily, many of their specialized bids and conventions simply didn't come up. . . . It was not only negative doubles that were few and far between.

Technically, the match was on a very high plane indeed—there were few errors of dummy play or defense; of these few, not more than three or four were really glaring. And the bidding errors were generally ones involving fine judgment, not gross overbids or underbids.\n\nSlam bidding was the worst department for both teams. The U.S. bid twelve slams—five made, seven went down. We missed four good slams that would have made, and one good one that wouldn't. One of the U.S. slams that made should have been beaten; conversely, one of those beaten should have been made. All in all, a miserable showing.\n\nThe Italians were no better. They bid only eight slams—four made, four didn't. That looks almost respectable, but they missed five good slams, and, of the four they bid and made, two were in the wrong contract and one should have been beaten. One of the slams they bid and went down on was a good contract, but they luckily stayed out of another good one that only failed because of stacked cards.\n\nI came to no conclusions about the \"battle of the systems.\" Somehow, there were very few strictly systemic swings—either pickups or losses—for the Neapolitan or Roman systems. Roth-Stone seemed to have quite a few systemic losses, but the results are inconclusive. The other Americans did fairly well with psychics, unimpressively with preempts, jump overcalls, disastrously with weak two-bids. I saw no signs that anyone was losing points through unfamiliarity with the meaning of his opponents' bidding. The swings were due to judgment, rarely to system at all.\n\nOver the long match luck was fairly even. The Americans lost, on my reckoning, 51 IMP through unlucky swings. They gained 44 IMP in lucky ones. (By luck, I mean good contracts going down, bad ones making; slams on finesses, guess situations on lead, etc.) We were, then, slightly unlucky, but not enough to make the difference.\n\nWe lost because we were outplayed; we did a few more good things than the Italians did, but a lot more bad things. But don't believe that vague impression floating around (at least here in New York) that the U.S. players performed miserably in Como. That's not true. I think they played better than almost any"

Technically, the match was on a very high plane indeed—there were few errors of dummy play or defense; of these few, not more than three or four were really glaring. And the bidding errors were generally ones involving fine judgment, not gross overbids or underbids.\n\nSlam bidding was the worst department for both teams. The U.S. bid twelve slams—five made, seven went down. We missed four good slams that would have made, and one good one that wouldn't. One of the U.S. slams that made should have been beaten; conversely, one of those beaten should have been made. All in all, a miserable showing.\n\nThe Italians were no better. They bid only eight slams—four made, four didn't. That looks almost respectable, but they missed five good slams, and, of the four they bid and made, two were in the wrong contract and one should have been beaten. One of the slams they bid and went down on was a good contract, but they luckily stayed out of another good one that only failed because of stacked cards.\n\nI came to no conclusions about the \"battle of the systems.\" Somehow, there were very few strictly systemic swings—either pickups or losses—for the Neapolitan or Roman systems. Roth-Stone seemed to have quite a few systemic losses, but the results are inconclusive. The other Americans did fairly well with psychics, unimpressively with preempts, jump overcalls, disastrously with weak two-bids. I saw no signs that anyone was losing points through unfamiliarity with the meaning of his opponents' bidding. The swings were due to judgment, rarely to system at all.\n\nOver the long match luck was fairly even. The Americans lost, on my reckoning, 51 IMP through unlucky swings. They gained 44 IMP in lucky ones. (By luck, I mean good contracts going down, bad ones making; slams on finesses, guess situations on lead, etc.) We were, then, slightly unlucky, but not enough to make the difference.\n\nWe lost because we were outplayed; we did a few more good things than the Italians did, but a lot more bad things. But don't believe that vague impression floating around (at least here in New York) that the U.S. players performed miserably in Como. That's not true. I think they played better than almost any"

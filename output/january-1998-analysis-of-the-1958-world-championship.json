The good news is that this month's problems, other than this clunker, have enough meat to them that we don't need to waste much space here.\n\nWhen we first played matchpoints, we learned the principle that the spade suit was key. Why in the world have we chosen to bury it?\n\nIRA RUBIN: \"One heart. With limited strength (albeit juicy spots), it's doubtful that you can get both suits in, so try to inform partner as best you can.\"\n\nPHILLIP ALDER: \"One heart. If my minors were reversed, I would probably opt for one spade, aiming to show both suits, but here we might well belong in diamonds.\"\n\nSAMI KEHELA: \"One heart. Awkward. May lose the spade fit.\"\n\nCARL HUDECEK: \"One heart. I am temporarily ignoring spades, with RHO probably four-four in the majors.\"\n\nThis loss of spades rates to be more than temporary. If you neglect to bid the master suit now, the odds are high that it's gone forever. Yet, it doesn't bother our intrepid panel a whit.\n\nAL ROTH: \"One heart. I take no aggressive action, and I hope to slow the bidding down. If I bid two clubs, I might hear three clubs from West and more clubs from East. I will not get shut out after one heart.\"\n\nIt is nice that you would like to slow the auction down; however, one of your opponents has mentioned a suit that you seem to be lacking. This slow-"

Avarelli's spade overcall is reasonable; so is Belladonna's pass over two diamonds. Forquet's opening at the other table is sound, and while Siniscalco's three-diamond bid is questionable, I refuse to charge it, for I probably would have bid three diamonds myself—at IMP scoring, nonvulnerable, with both opponents passed hands.\n\nReally, Roth and Stone created the swing out of thin air—Stone, with his third-hand pass and his courageous vulnerable three-level overcall; Roth, with his pass over one diamond and his excellent penalty double of three diamonds.\n\nSo I gave Roth and Stone a credit of five IMP.

Assuming that this doesn't get passed out, I will be able to complete a very accurate description of my hand on the next round; partner can make the final competitive decision. A four-diamond splinter would overstate the strength of the hand and hide the important club features. Also, I would like a club lead if we defend against a high-level diamond contract.\"\n\nCaravelli, Carruthers, Eisenberg, Kokish, Lowenthal and Smith all bemoaned the unavailability of a fit-showing jump to four clubs. Although we, too, prefer this gadget, we are much too nice to complain.\n\nSome preferred a four-diamond splinter.\n\n**Mary & Max Hardy:** \"Four diamonds. In our methods, we use concealed splinters. Opener is able to distinguish between a singleton and a void in responder's hand, but does not ask unless interested in a slam—thus, there is no opening-lead blueprint at game contracts.\"\n\nA very nice convention, assuming that you can convince your opponents to remain silent.\n\n**Marshall Miles:** \"Four diamonds. I wish I were slightly stronger, but partner doesn't need much for a slam if his hand fits mine, especially if he has a singleton spade.\"\n\nThat is the problem with four diamonds. Although you are barely of minimum strength, an attractive pattern opposite (short spades, not short clubs) is the key to this hand. Four diamonds, two notrump and four hearts do nothing to discover the solution of the spade-club mystery. Additionally, we do not like to splinter with all of our values in one suit. We consider a typical splinter to be more spread out.\n\nSeveral rejected four diamonds in favor of two notrump.\n\n**Chip Martel:** \"Two notrump. Better hand for a fit-showing jump. However, since neither that nor my own method (where three clubs is a good four-card single raise) is BWS, I'll settle for two notrump (planning to drive to four hearts). Four diamonds is a bit too much for me, particularly since it gives partner no space to wiggle.\"\n\n**Jeff Rubens:** \"Two notrump. It is easier for West to double four diamonds than to bid three diamonds. I have too high a defense-to-offense ratio (with such weak hearts) for a semi-psychic preempt.\"\n\n**Eric Rodwell:** \"Two notrump. Just short of four diamonds. I want to save space, in case partner is strong. Over three clubs, I can jump to four diamonds.\"\n\nYes, at least the two-notrump bidders have a chance of getting the auction to go great for them.\n\nNineties-style bridge is more obstructionist than ever. If you want to be known as a tough opponent, jump to the maximum at every opportunity and hope for the best. Most good bridge players like to be thought of as difficult opponents, so here we present the macho men.\n\n**Mahmood Zia:** \"Four hearts. It's hard for them to bid five diamonds—even with six.\"\n\n**Ira Rubin:** \"Four hearts.

Note that on a high-spade lead Zia could (and probably would) have made the contract via the endplay if he takes the ruffing finesse in spades and times the play carefully. The Closed Room contract was five clubs, and the hefty swing pushed the French lead to 27 imps.\n\nFrance seemed on the road to a substantial victory, but on the next board Perron, North, held,\n\n♠ T52 ♥ Q96 ♦ K52 ♣ 8643,\n\nand heard this auction:"

I admit there are times when we will miss a game, but it seems too risky in the long run to double.\"\n\nWe remain unconvinced either way. Let's now look at the spicier comments on F1.\n\nIRA RUBIN: \"F1. No. Double is mandatory, and pass is purgatory.\"\n\nRON GERARD: \"F1. No. . . . Partner won't leave in a double except in months divisible by four.\"\n\nIs that a shot at us? Last time we checked, January wasn't divisible by four, so we wonder if his attack is directed towards our April/August/December guy, Mr. Woolsey. Nah, it's probably aimed at us. But what's so bad if partner leaves in our negative double? We have an ace and a doubleton in his suit to lead. We'd be more nervous with a third club, which could crash his potential club tricks.

This surely is not the same circumstance.\n\nGerard and Kokish think North can be 3=3=2=5, and mention Total Tricks.

I was surprised that declarer didn't duck the second round also, which would have put even more pressure on Rosenberg to find safe discards. Guided by Zia's order of play in clubs (with spade strength, Zia would have played king-then-queen), Rosenberg discarded a heart. Chemla cashed ace of diamonds and ace-king of spades, then led a diamond. Had he known that diamonds were four-one, he would have ducked; not knowing, he went up with dummy's king and was in trouble. Having no other hope, declarer continued with the queen and another diamond. East carelessly kept his remaining spade. This convinced Rosenberg that declarer had a third spade, and, as we American rooters watched in horror, Rosenberg played a spade, giving declarer the contract. This was a big swing, as the U. S. stopped safely in three diamonds.\n\nOn Board 10, Zia, with jack-seven of clubs in the closed hand opposite king-eight-six-four in dummy, announced a claim that included a statement that he would play his LHO for the ace of clubs. LHO's actual holding was singleton ace. I was curious about what the ruling might have been if the defender had happened to hold the singleton queen of clubs. Would declarer have been assumed to have led a low club toward the king, or could he be forced to lead the jack after the claim?\n\nBoth sides reached a good grand slam in spades with,"

Chemla ducked the king of diamonds and won the diamond continuation, Rosenberg retaining his queen. When declarer led the jack of hearts, covered by the queen and ace, it looked to me as though Chemla could count out Rosenberg's hand, cash the ace of clubs, and endplay him with the third spade for down one. In fact, declarer did cash the ace of clubs, but then he continued with the queen. There were some very nervous moments as Zia considered ducking this trick, which would have allowed declarer to revert to the endplay. At last, Zia won with his king, Rosenberg pitched a heart, and the diamond return set the contract two tricks. This board was a push, as the U. S. was in three hearts, down two, in the Closed Room.\n\nThe next deal showed off \"declarer's advantage\" by demonstrating how difficult it can be to defend effectively at the beginning of the play when few clues are available."

If you like that half as much as we do, you'll be delighted. We admit there is one tiny problem with adding color, increasing content, buying new computers, enlarging the staff, and upgrading services: How are we going to pay for it? Our plan is to produce a very large increase in the subscription list. That's where you come in. Please tell your bridge friends about the new, larger, more colorful Bridge World; promote our Internet site: www.bridgeworld.com. Send us the name and address of a potential subscriber—we'll send a sample issue and mention your name. Give gift subscriptions: Your recipients will think kindly of you every month, and if your partners read the magazine you will profit directly at the table. To promote gift-giving, the traditional bonus offer has been made more generous. For each gift you give, you will get a book for yourself.

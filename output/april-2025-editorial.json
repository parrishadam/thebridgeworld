        "text": "**More Might Help**\n\nOne of the side effects of the explosion of cheating accusations and convictions is the inconsistency of the information provided to the bridge-playing public. This in turn has led to suspicion about procedures, lack of uniformity, and favoritism. More disclosure might alleviate these concerns.\n\nFor example, the details of the sentences pronounced after convictions are often omitted. Comparing some of the outcomes makes it appear that much-different punishments were handed down for equivalent offenses. There may be good reasons for concealing the background (e.g., one of the convicts provided useful information about other cases or had a previously-unrevealed record of past offenses). In any case, transparency demands that at least the types of considerations that may apply be made public.\n\nIt is also relevant for independent observers to be given a chance to decide whether differences in outcomes is a by-product of the lack of overall structure in organized bridge. One suspects that this situation is further evidence of the value of having a pyramid-like structure where the subunits at each level have agreed to follow the policies of the group. Furthermore, the apparent reluctance to publicize procedures is more evidence of the confusion sowed by having multiple tails wagging the dog. That some details must not be publicized (those that would help potential crooks evade detection, for example) should be part of the disclosure.\n\nAnother way that uniformity of activities within organized bridge could show a gain is through increased sharing of ideas about how to prevent or to discourage cheating in the first place. What about physical arrangements? Which detection methods work best? Are current punishments appropriate? What obstacles have arisen, and how were they overcome (or not)? The more people and groups that share this intelligence, the better off all will be."

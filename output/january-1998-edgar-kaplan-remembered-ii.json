Responder can relay again for loser count (which should be without adjustments so that responder can count his cover cards). If responder does not start with a relay, his bid shows a splinter in a six-loser hand.]\n\n*Three notrump* shows 5-3-3-2.

        "text": "Newspaper columnists who write for local publications suffer under a severe handicap: They are constrained by the truth. How they must frequently yearn to change a card or two, or a call or play, to purify a deal of its real-world flaws. This hindrance reduces the flavor of some of the articles in **The Times Book of Bridge** (Batsford; 112 pages; $13.95 paperbound), an eclectic collection of Robert Sheehan's work for The Times of London. Despite this drawback and some unevenness in level of topic sophistication and depth of analysis, we think most avid bridge readers, especially non-Britons, will find the book worthwhile. Warts and all, the deals have points of interest. Sheehan, one of the current generation's most successful European competitors, has a good eye for what serious players will find intriguing. Several problem situations present fresh challenges. We singled out non-Britons above because the parts of the book we liked best were those that revolved around in-depth portraits of several of the leading British bridge personalities, both alive and dead. Some of the deals and anecdotes in those chapters were new to us, and the section on the late Irving Rose sparkled brightly enough to provide sufficient light for an entire book.\n\nAvailable from The Bookshelf [TIMES]\n\n*                    *                    *"

        "text": "On the surface, Alan Mould's **\"Preempts\"** (Batsford; 143 pages; $16.95 paperback) is designed to present the fundamental techniques of opening and responding to preemptives, to describe today's widely varying styles and the tradeoffs among them, to create awareness of the opportunities for obstructive tactics other than openings, and to add occasional observations and personal comments about which choices of approach and method seem to the author more or less likely to be successful.\n\nThis book does all that, but . . . *surprise!* The best part is a large, excellently presented, theoretical section on card values, how to judge whether your strength is offensive or defensive, comparison of risks and rewards—in short, just the sort of knowledge one needs to advance from formula follower to intelligent bidder. This discussion is simple, easy to follow, and right on target. It is introduced in the context of deciding whether or not to open a three-bid, and thus is mildly mislabeled (because it applies much more generally), but this part alone is worth the price of the book to an improving player. That's two winners for Mould's commonsense approach to advanced bidding topics; his book on slam bidding has similar positive characteristics.\n\nAvailable from The Bookshelf [PRE]\n\n*        *        *\n\nThe second book in the Card Play Made Easy series by Ron Klinger and Andrew Kambites is **\"Know Your Suit Combinations\"** (Gollancz; 96 pages; $13.95 paperbound). The book begins with and throughout emphasizes the critical concept in the area of analyzing how to handle individual suit holdings: distinguishing between the abstract correct play in isolation and the appropriate handling in the context of trying to make a contract. This theme is handled well, especially in the 36 quiz deals that augment the lessons and numerous individual suit discussions. The tutorial level is elementary to low intermediate, but most of the quiz deals stretch to greater challenges. Overall, the book is good, but we cannot give it our highest recommendation because the authors goof in a few places, messing up an occasional analysis while trying to set up the desired theme. We sympathize; we've been there ourselves.\n\nAvailable from The Bookshelf [CPME2]\n\n*        *        *\n\nTony Sowter's **\"Step-By-Step Competitive Bidding\"** (Batsford; 143 pages; $16.95 paperbound) is a solid introduction to contested auctions, both what we would call \"competitive\" (your side opens, the opponents act) and \"defensive\" (the opponents open). Unfortunately, as we have seen before in similar British books, the overcalling style on opposite sides of the Atlantic is so different that the text will be misleading to American readers. The first example hand,\n\n♠ K Q 10 4 2  ♥ 4 2  ♦ K 6 2  ♣ 7 4 2,\n\nis described as a \"perfect hand for a minimum one-spade overcall at any vulnerability.\" This is far removed"

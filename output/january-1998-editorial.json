You plan to win the (say, red-suit) return, ruff a club, cross to hand with a trump, ruff a second club, return to the other red suit, draw trumps and claim. Only a red-suit void or a horrific club split will doom this plan. Note that you would be slightly more exposed to a ruff or an overruff if you trumped any clubs before losing a spade trick."

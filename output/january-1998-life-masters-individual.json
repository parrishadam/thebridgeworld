He tried for three notrump with his cue-bid, then subsided when Lars repeated clubs. Much of the time, this extra level wouldn't be fatal.\n\nIs it better to play East's double of two hearts for takeout or for penalty? Traditionally, over the enemy length, it is for penalties.

(When polling pairs using variable ranges, one is tempted out of curiosity to ask for certain deals to be bid twice, once with each range.) Many Acol players would start with one heart, but the Danes sensibly bid four-card suits up the line opposite an unpassed partner. Over the strong-notrump rebid, Lars jumped to three clubs to describe his invitational five-five in the blacks.

He made it with an overtrick too, because the spades split; but of course the Italians bid four hearts at the other table and made it easily. Who was responsible for the four IMP loss?\n\nRoth's jump overcall is certainly atypical, but I don't think it is unreasonable on this vulnerability, facing a passed hand. Obviously, he must have felt that the hand belonged to the enemy and that it was worth a little risk to disrupt their communications. Probably the danger of his missing four hearts never occurred to him. Personally, I consider Stone to be the guilty party. Granted that he believes in \"sound\" opening bids; surely he could \"take his life in his hands\" and open this holding.\n\n*\n\nThe concept of supersound openings was costly to Roth and Stone on other hands . . . [They] paid for their solid openings in a different way when they overbid to doubtful games on Deals 33 and 106. In both cases a passed hand jumped to two notrump over a third-hand opening, and both times the original passes were normal, with 11 and 12-point hands. But in each case opener carried on to three notrump with a skinny minimum opening, clearly hoping for a strictly \"Roth-Stone\" passed hand of 13 points or better. The result? Down one; down one. Six IMP lost.\n\nDo you suppose that opener went on in these instances because he hadn't opened a very light \"third-hand\" bid? But Roth and Stone weren't opening light hands in third or fourth seat. Stone passed, third-hand:"

Crawford's rebid is a problem—perhaps a two-spade underbid or a three-spade overbid would be better, but two clubs looks all right. And by now the Americans were on the hook, for no one wanted to bid notrump without a heart stopper. Oh, Becker might bid two diamonds, not three clubs; Crawford might bid three, not four, spades.

With a small heart lead, declarer has no option—he must put in the nine.

Then Fallenius, West, used three relays to learn that Nilsland had 1=5=3=4 shape. Four clubs set hearts as trumps, four diamonds was a cue-bid, four notrump RKCB, five notrump a general grand-slam try, and six clubs a cue-bid showing that king. So, Fallenius knew he had the perfect jack—well bid!\n\nBWS auction: two clubs — two diamonds — two hearts — three hearts — four clubs — four diamonds — four spades [?] — six hearts — pass.\n\nAwards: 7♥ 10; 6♥ 6; 6 NT 4; 6♣ 3; 5♥, 5 NT 2."

This resulted, it may be recalled, in a five club sacrifice, down 700, when five diamonds might well have been made.\n\nI charged Rapée with a substantial loss, but I have sympathy for his bid. The alternative is to pass (planning on backing in later with an unusual notrump overcall), and it seems to me that, first-hand in this vulnerability situation, the terribly weak freak holding calls for some sort of drastic preemptive action.\n\nRapée played a very active style in Como; he was always on the move, trying to create favorable swings; yet this was the only one of his \"operations\" that ended in American disaster. He psyched repeatedly and was never punished. On Deal 130 he jostled the Italians into a six-spade contract that needed a 3-3 trump split—they got it—while the Americans played in a cold six-diamond spot after an unimpeded auction; and on Deals 108 and 140, previously discussed, his psychics gained heavily. Moreover, the unsettling effect on opponents should not be discounted.\n\n*\n\nI charged Rapée for the rather ludicrous result on Deal 139:"

I imagine he intended the two diamonds as a cue-bid for the majors, but I think that Silodor was right to play it to be a suit, at least until the bid got doubled.

Nilsland thinks his final pass was timid, but that jack of clubs is a big card.\n\nThe Danes had a routine Acol auction. Morten couldn't risk three notrump opposite unknown clubs.\n\nBWS auction: The same as that produced by the Lund Madsen brothers.\n\nAwards: 3 NT 9; 2 NT 6; 3 ♣ 5; 2 ♥ 3; 4 ♣ 2; 3 ♥ 1.\n\n**Final score:** Fallenius-Nilsland 75; Lars-Morten 69.\n\nThe Swedes squeak out a close win.

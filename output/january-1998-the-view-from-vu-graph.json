        "text": "As the coach of the USA-1 team in the 1997 Bermuda Bowl, played during October in Tunisia, I had many opportunities to watch matches on the Vu-Graph. One nice feature of this perspective is that you get the advantages of being a spectator, yet can openly discuss the deal as it is being played, gaining additional insights from the observations of others. Of course, anyone who can see all four hands must take great care not to let knowledge of the layout affect his analysis or evaluation of the players' actions.\n\nIn Tunisia, the smart money made three teams roughly equal co-favorites to win the Bowl: France and the two United States entries. This time, the smart money was smart indeed. All three teams reached the semifinals, and France defeated USA-2 narrowly in the final. This report follows the 20-board-match between France and USA-1 in the qualifying round-robin, one of the most interesting I have ever seen, from the position of a Vu-Graph observer. I emphasize my thoughts as I was watching and discussing the match. To preserve the flavor of an actual Vu-Graph show, we override the usual Bridge World procedure of making South the declarer when possible and instead leave the players in their fixed geographical positions throughout the article: For the U. S., Michael Rosenberg was West and Mahmood Zia East; for France, Paul Chemla was South and Michel Perron North."

This seems impossible, as declarer has three trump losers in addition to other problems. However, observe what can happen on a spade lead. Declarer wins the finesse, and cashes all his top tricks, ruffing two spades in the closed hand and a diamond in dummy. At trick ten, declarer leads another diamond. West, who has followed suit throughout, ruffs, and dummy overruffs with the ten. When a club is led from dummy, West can do no better than overruff with the nine and then lead away from his ace of hearts. Magic! My audience-mate, Joanna Stansby, pointed out that West could have avoided the endplay and gained a trick through the odd play of ruffing the last diamond with his ace of hearts.\n\nThink along with Zia on Board 4. With both sides vulnerable, there are two passes to you. What call would you make with, ♠83 ♥J9875 ♦AQJ42 ♣J?\n\nZia earned a nice swing by opening a weak two diamonds. This directed what would have been the killing lead against three notrump, a contract bid and made in Closed Room after a third-position one-heart opening. The French tried five clubs, defeated one trick.\n\nAfter both sides bid aggressively to a thin game that made, France picked up a big swing from the good and bad luck attached to different leads against a game contract.\n\nBoard 7 was not too interesting in the match—both teams went down after opening a strong notrump when they could have succeeded in a four-four spade fit—, but it was a lively one in our discussion group. Joanna and I constantly debate the merits weak notrump vs. strong notrump. She clearly won this round. The deal also showed the different ways that random events can influence the results. Zia and Rosenberg use weak notrumps nonvulnerable, strong notrumps vulnerable. Unfortunately for the U. S., they were vulnerable here.\n\nOne of the problems with opening a"

I was wondering if it might not be better immediately to play the ace and king of hearts, continuing with a heart ruff high if an honor fell on the second round. If both heart honors come down, the contract will then be cold regardless of the black-suit splits. However, this approach loses on some four-one club splits when the actual line of play would have succeeded, such as when a defender holds two trumps and one club. Perhaps the answer depends on how often it will occur to the defenders to dump a heart honor on the second round of hearts and thus deflect declarer to a losing line of play. Another possible improvement for South is to cash a high club at trick two. Then, if the club queen drops, heart ace, heart ruff high, diamond ace, heart ruff high, spade nine to dummy, draw trumps, club jack, diamond king, club king. On the lie of the cards, all plays were booked for success, so the result was duplicated."

We agree. To bid five-over-five you should have extreme shape. Perhaps a weak hand with a seven-card suit, or maybe a diamond void. We can't know for sure how many trumps there are (Carruthers' math seems to point to about 20), and the Law does not give us a perfect conclusion. If partner is 4=4=0=5, then bidding surely will be right, but if he has that 3=3=2=5 strong hand, we're best off passing. Since it's a guess, why not follow the well-known bridge adages?\n\nKIT WOOLSEY (and ERIC RODWELL similarly): \"F3. Pass. When in doubt, let the opponents play at the five level. We have no assurance of a good fit, and, when we have a good fit, no guarantee that we will find it.\"\n\nOr maybe even real-life clichés?\n\nSAMI KEHELA: \"F3. Pass. Half a loaf is better than no bread.\"\n\nHow about this old catchphrase:\n\nCHIP MARTEL: \"F3. Pass. I would pass and 'stay fixed.' \"\n\nWe have the optimistic passers . . .\n\nCARL HUDECEK: \"F3.

If you don't pass the double, you must choose a major, or, gulp, drive to slam. First, something we can stomach, the five-heart vs. five-spade argument:\n\nHENRY BETHE: \"F3. Five spades. Generally, the weaker trump suit is better since it makes it harder for the opponents to take ruffs.\"\n\nIRA RUBIN: \"F3. Five hearts. Picking the stronger color.\"\n\nRON GERARD: \"F3. Five hearts. Any bid shows values. Opposite a prototype, playing in hearts lets you see some more cards before facing the spade position.\"\n\nERIC KOKISH: \"F3. Five spades. To prevent the impending spade ruffs against five hearts. Of course, it could be right to play in hearts to prevent a club ruff against five spades.\"\n\nThe only comment from the cosmonauts—we have some new Russian subscribers; their launch into slam is likely to keep their partners from ever opening the bidding and competing again—came from:\n\nPHILLIP ALDER: \"F3. Six diamonds. If I thought partner could be 3=3=2=5 (instead of 4=4=0=5 or 4=4=1=4), I would pass.

Because of that, the other East bid more aggressively after West's second double, and the final contract was six clubs. On the bidding, South figured to have six spades, so the French declarer chose to play North for the queen of clubs. This gave the U. S. a favorable swing that could have been just as large a loss."

        "text": "**TOURNAMENT REPORT**\n\n**PEACHTREE SOLOWAY**\n\nBY OREN KRIEGEL, CHICAGO\n\nAtlanta played host to the 2023 Fall Nationals. Overall tournament attendance relative to 2022 held steady, but participation in the premier knockout event, the Soloway, was up: 62 entrants compared to 53 the year before.\n\nA two-day Swiss qualifier cut the field nearly in half, to 32 teams; this was followed by five rounds of day-long knockout matches. Seeding in the Soloway is based on a combination of each team's seeding points and placement in the qualifier. KNOTTENBELT and WADEMARK topped the Swiss, but third-place finisher LEBOWITZ became the top seed.\n\nNo major upsets occurred in the round of 32. Instead, the marquee matchup was #14 NICKELL vs. #19 FLEISHER (T. Bessis, Lorenzini; Fleisher, Martel; Sementa, Versace), a combination of opponents never seen until later in other knockouts; FLEISHER emerged victorious. That team continued with wins over #3 WADEMARK and #6 AMOILS to reach the semifinals, where it faced #7 STREET (Di Franco, Manno; L'Ecuyer, Street; Pachtmann, Zatorski). On the other side of the bracket, #8 GOODMAN (de Wijs, Muller; Donati, Percario; Goodman, Passell) got past LEBOWITZ and encountered #5 ZIMMERMANN (Brink, Drijver; Kalita, Klukowski; Nowosadzki, Zimmermann) in its semifinal match."

Would your partnership have been on firm ground about South's responsibilities over four hearts and the meaning of North's four spades at his third turn? If you are willing to give up defending against four hearts undoubled, perhaps opener should always bid four spades with three unless doubling for penalty. It would take a very-well-practiced partnership to be confident about such an uncommon auction.\n\nIn his inelegant contract, Street received the heart-eight lead to his queen. He played the ace-king of clubs, getting the bad news, then crossed to the diamond ace, threw a diamond on the heart ace, and led a spade. Lorenzini played the jack, won the next spade, and tapped dummy with a heart. The defender was then able to ruff the third spade and cash the club queen, resulting in down three: minus 500. Declarer's chances were almost nonexistent, and he lacked the entries to play both spades"

One option, going all out, was to lead the club jack at trick two and then play high spades from dummy. That path would have led to success as the cards lay.\n\nIn the Closed Room, Street's teammate Manno found himself in a painful situation of his own. On lead with the bulk of the defensive assets, he started with the spade ace and another spade. Versace drew trumps (Manno threw a heart) and ducked a diamond to Manno's jack. The club continuation resolved that suit: making four, plus 420 and 14 imps to FLEISHER. Di Franco had played his spades up the line, but if he had played middle-low-high, Manno might have tried the diamond king next, which almost certainly would have defeated the contract. Versace would have ducked, won the third round of the suit, thrown a club on the heart, and tried to navigate clubs. (The winning double-dummy line is to win and to run the club jack without cashing the heart ace, then to exit in diamonds, forcing the defense to play a rounded suit.)\n\nFLEISHER led by 27 imps with 12 deals remaining, but then STREET went on a 47-0 run over seven deals, starting with a game swing on Board 49:"

His teammates scored 850 in five spades doubled, so running from one doomed slam to another proved more costly than it often is at imp scoring. Zimmermann lost 13 imps, rather than the likely 6 imps it would have lost for minus 1100 in six diamonds doubled, and there was a (very-slight) chance of a 2-imp pickup if Goodman had eschewed a club lead.\n\nZimmermann's lead swelled to 30 imps after the second quarter, in part because it came out on top on the freak deal of the set (Board 21):"

Declarer's play looks right, as there was little distributional information that would have changed the odds. Unfortunately for his team, the contract was played from the opposite side at the companion table; East led a low heart, and dummy's eight held. That simplified things considerably, and the contract succeeded: 17 imps to Zimmermann.\n\nIt would be Zimmermann vs. Street in the final.\n\n**The Final**\n\nThe 2023 Soloway final, Zimmermann (Brink, Drijver; Kalita, Klukowski; Nowosadzki, Zimmermann) vs. Street (Di Franco, Manno; L'Ecuyer, Street; Pachtmann, Zatorski), was an approximate rerun of the thrilling 2022 Spingold final, in which a somewhat different version of Zimmermann prevailed over an identical Street team by a single imp.\n\nOn the Zimmermann side, Brink-Drijver was the only returning partnership. Kalita and Nowosadzki, previously a pairing on other teams, split up to play with Klukowski and Zimmermann, respectively. Brink-Drijver employed Dutch Doubleton, a short-club system; Kalita-Klukowski played a Polish Club base; and Nowosadzki-Zimmermann used mainstream methods. All three pairs used two diamonds to show a weak two-bid in either major and two of a major to announce a weak major-minor two-suiter. For Street, Di Franco-Manno and Pachtmann-Zatorski used transfer responses to one club. L'Ecuyer-Street and Pachtmann-Zatorski used two-bids similar to the Zimmermann pairs, while Di Franco-Manno showed 18-19 HCP in a balanced hand via a two-diamond opening.\n\n**First Quarter**\n\nTo begin the match, Zimmermann fielded Kalita-Klukowski and Nowosadzki-Zimmermann. Di Franco-Manno and L'Ecuyer-Street started for Street.\n\nA minor defensive slip on Board 1 gave Zimmermann 1 imp; then, Street won 7 imps when notrump ranges worked in its favor. This was Board 3 (South dealer; East-West vulnerable):"

Klukowski bid four spades directly and played there unmolested; Street passed and backed in with four spades, which drew a double. Four hearts would have made on the nose, while four spades failed by a trick, so that was 3 imps to Zimmermann, tying the match.\n\nYou are in second seat at your favorable vulnerability.

West might have countered with five hearts, knowing that his partner could have discovered his aces with a key-card ask. East might have signed off over six hearts—although six hearts was defined as a queen-ask, the logic of the auction might have overridden that message; West might merely have been authorizing his partner to bid seven with a similar hand and stronger diamonds.\n\nAfter a club lead, both declarers discarded a club and a diamond on the high hearts, then led a diamond to the queen. That lost, but Nowosadzki's contract was still a favorite. Alas for declarer, not only were diamonds five-two but North could overruff dummy. Street was lucky to lose only 3 imps.\n\nA flat deal followed, then 4 imps in extra undertricks went to Zimmermann when L'Ecuyer-Street drove too high. This was Board 10:"

West shifted to the spade queen, exposing East to a three-suit squeeze as declarer cashed dummy's last heart. Again, the play was the same at both tables: each defender released a diamond, while declarer discarded a club. Street tried a club to the queen, which resulted in down two, but even if the club queen had won, nine tricks would have been a long way off.\n\nKlukowski took a better shot, playing for the friendly diamond lie. The diamond jack was covered by the queen and king, ducked by West. Declarer accurately continued with the ten. Manno could have tested Klukowski by exiting in diamonds (finishing the diamonds would have turned the screw on East, neutralizing the spade threat or letting declarer guess clubs for one loser) but instead played a spade, letting declarer attempt a club finesse for an overtrick: making three, plus 600; 13 imps to Zimmermann. If West had kept all of his diamonds, declarer could have succeeded with accurate card reading.\n\nWest considered shifting to a low spade instead of the queen, which might have been a better choice (and would have succeeded as the cards lay). The obvious upside of shifting to the queen was when declarer holds the singleton jack; but even then, shifting to the queen might have squeezed East among three suits. If declarer had held, e.g.:\n\n♠ J ♥ AQx ♦ KQxx ♣ QJT0xx\n\nand played low on the low-spade shift, that shift could cost the contract. With that hand, though, declarer might have bid differently or played on spades himself. If declarer held 1=3=3=6, the defense might have been able to deny a dummy entry if a low-spade shift goes to the jack; also, with that holding declarer might have pursued clubs initially."

He shifted to the heart deuce, finding his partner with just what he hoped for—a heart honor and (if the ten) an entry. Kalita drove out the diamond ace first, so Di Franco cleared the heart suit, letting Manno cash out for down one: minus 100. If declarer had happened to knock out Manno's entry first, the defender could have reverted to clubs and hoped that his partner could gain the lead and cash enough winners.\n\nIn the Closed Room, holding up in clubs looked futile, because East very likely would have opened with both missing aces, so L'Ecuyer won trick one. He played on diamonds, happy to see that West held the ace. After taking the second diamond, Nowosadzki could have played for South to hold ace-jack-doubleton of clubs, but he shifted to the spade nine. When declarer ducked in dummy, Zimmermann could have achieved down three by winning and putting a club through, but he did not want to set up three spade tricks for his opponent. The defense was still on track for down one, but on the run of the diamonds, Zimmermann released his remaining club, letting declarer set up the game-going trick in spades: 12 imps to STREET. East should have re-evaluated after learning that L'Ecuyer held five diamonds; for the opening bid, declarer had to hold the heart king or club queen-jack, so unless the defense could run clubs, the contract was cold.\n\nZIMMERMANN added an imp when Klukowski found a more-effective defense than Street.

More importantly, Nowosadzki and Zimmermann avoided a double. Both contracts went down two; minus 500 and minus 200 put 7 imps in the ZIMMERMANN column; that team then led by 18.\n\nOn the last seven deals of the segment, the contract (though not always the declarer) was the same at both tables, and the swings were modest: 1- and 2-imp swings to STREET and a 2-imp gain for ZIMMERMANN. Still, there were points of interest.\n\nBoard 28 presented a contrast of modern opening-lead styles. With only the opponents vulnerable, your RHO deals and opens one notrump, which ends the auction. Holding:\n\n♠ 8 7 2  ♥ J 10 5  ♦ A 4 2  ♣ A J 9 6,\n\nwhat would you lead? Expert practice has long since moved on from a fourth-highest club.

Street won with the king. As the cards lay, a heart or club continuation would have guaranteed the defeat of the contract. Projecting all possible sequences of play is easier at the bar than at the table, and Street went for the practical assault on declarer's trump holding by playing a diamond. L'Ecuyer took the ace and played the spade ten; now it was Zimmermann's turn in the spotlight. If, as it appeared, East held the missing spade king, he needed to ruff with the ace, then to guess trumps. In practice, he ruffed with the seven, and Street overruffed for the setting trick.

(Given West's initial pass, losing the heart entry for a diamond finesse cannot cost, as West cannot hold both the spade ace and diamond king.) If West continues with a low heart to East's honor, declarer will need to guess how to proceed. Ducking is necessary on a layout such as the actual one; but if West holds five hearts, declarer should win and may be defeated if he does not. Success will depend on placing the unseen cards accurately. Given the uncertainty that follows holding up, plus the extra chance that winning will induce a defensive misstep, perhaps Brink's play was best.\n\nOn the succeeding deal (Board 39), Di Franco's defense was more effective:"

He led the club king (ducked) and continued with the queen to dummy's ace. Kalita ran dummy's diamond ten to the ace, and Di Franco played the club nine; Manno threw the spade eight (odd count or discouraging with high suit preference), and declarer ruffed. Kalita crossed to the spade ace and led a diamond to the jack and a ruff. Di Franco needed to lead a club for an uppercut, but instead he tried a low heart. Declarer won and led a spade; whether or not Di Franco trumped, the defense could take only two further trump tricks: making two, plus 110; 2 imps to ZIMMERMANN.

        "text": "In the Open Room, Di Franco led the heart king: ace, seven, ten. Kalita called for the diamond jack, and Manno took the king to continue with the heart three to the jack and queen. If Di Franco had been confident that Manno held a doubleton heart, his best play would have been a heart, guaranteeing a beat unless declarer held a club void with the spade king; but the defender played the spade six. When Manno covered dummy's ten, that was the end for the defense, as Kalita had the transportation to discard his losing club: plus 110.\n\nDi Franco worried that his partner might have held the missing hearts—in which case dummy's eight-six would work a ruffing finesse against the nine—but if Manno began with nine-seven-five-three, would he have signaled with the potentially-valuable heart seven at trick one? From Manno's perspective, the spade six could have been from a holding such as Di Franco's, but a king-nine-six combination also was possible, especially if Di Franco held the missing heart length, as Manno reasonably could infer. If Di Franco always would have shifted to his lowest spade when holding the king, then withholding the spade queen could not cost—whatever his shape, declarer could have discarded no more than one spade. All in all, a tricky deal with many possible twists.\n\nAt the other table, the key decision came in the bidding: Pachtmann might have doubled four clubs. He had far from a sure defeat, and tipping off the trump position might have cost a trick (as it did here, it turned out). But the initial double had already flagged the location of most of the honors, and opportunities for swings against ZIMMERMANN's front four don't arise especially often. Of course, desperado tactics weren't called for yet, so I can't fault Pachtmann for lying low. Zatorski (South) led the heart jack to the queen and ace, and Pachtmann continued the suit. When declarer called for a low club, Pachtmann ducked, and Brink put up the queen. Brink played a club to the ace, then a spade; Pachtmann rose with the ace and took his club winners; declarer cashed out for down three. Minus 150 swung 1 imp to STREET, but STREET had left several imps on the table.\n\nSTREET added 4 imps on Board 49 (North dealer; East-West vulnerable):"

Brink drew trumps and cashed his winners: down two, minus 200.\n\nThere was a trump lead against Manno as well; declarer captured the ten with the ace and lost a heart finesse. Here, too, the defense needed to tap dummy to secure down two. Klukowski shifted to the diamond king, then played a club. Kalita won with the ace, cashed the diamond ace, and went back to clubs, expecting Klukowski not to hold the diamond jack—holding that card, he might have persisted with diamonds. Manno won with the club queen, cashed the heart ten, and played a trump.

Brink (East) led his singleton heart; Drijver won with the ace and, rather than give Brink a ruff at once, shifted to the spade eight. Pachtmann rose with the queen; Brink won and continued with the spade nine, which went to dummy's ten. Declarer played the ace and another diamond to Drijver, who gave Brink a heart ruff and received a spade ruff. Brink still had two black-suit winners to come: down two, minus 300.\n\nThe Open-Room proceedings featured more-modern bidding, permitting East-West to find their club fit. Klukowski thought he had a promising hand for offense and competed, but his side was then in serious jeopardy. Di Franco had already shown values and held dubious diamond honors, so he passed. Manno did too; he held potential spade tricks, but his club honors were suspect, and he did not know whether his opponents had reached a real fit. Di Franco led the spade three to the five, nine, and king; declarer led a heart toward dummy's queen. Grabbing the heart ace and playing another spade would have garnered down four, but Di Franco did not know that his partner held four spades, so he ducked. Kalita played the diamond ace, ruffed a diamond, and played another heart (because Di Franco could not have won the trick, a club would have been better at double-dummy). Di Franco won and played another spade through; Manno won with the jack and played club king, spade ace, low club. Kalita won and played the heart king, but Manno ruffed and led the club ace for down three: minus 150, but 4 imps to ZIMMERMANN.\n\nAfter a no-swing game came Board 54:"

        "text": "In the Open Room, Klukowski's aggressive approach caught a friendly-enough layout to make 10 tricks. East won the opening diamond lead and shifted to a trump, which Klukowski took in dummy. The spade ten was covered by the king and ace. Klukowski crossed to dummy in trumps and played two more spades, discarding a club. East could ruff, but the club ace was the defense's final trick: making four, plus 420. In the other room, the defense began with two rounds of diamonds, and Pachtmann led a low spade out of his hand, another route to 10 tricks: plus 170 but 6 imps to ZIMMERMANN.\n\nThat swing increased the ZIMMERMANN lead to 28 imps with six comparisons remaining. Board 55 generated a swing, but not in the direction STREET wanted. Klukowski and Pachtmann held:\n\n♠104 ♥J98 ♦AJT86 ♣QT7,\n\nand saw their partners open one notrump as dealer at favorable vulnerability. Klukowski responded three notrump; Pachtmann invited and reached two notrump. There were nine likely top tricks outside of spades, where opener held nine-seven-three. At single-dummy, a trailing team would be happy to see that combination, but spades divided four-four, and nine tricks rolled home: 6 imps to ZIMMERMANN.\n\nBoard 56 saw both tables reach a three-notrump contract that essentially required a successful finesse. It failed, and Klukowski went down 300. Still, his team gained 3 undertrick imps because Pachtmann played on another suit first—hoping to induce a defensive misstep and possibly obtaining information that might have justified taking an unusual line—which set up an eighth defensive winner.\n\nDown 37 with four deals left, time was fast running out for STREET. Board 57 kept a flicker of hope alive when Di Franco-Manno stayed low while Brink-Drijver failed in game, but STREET needed to do better than 6 imps per deal, and Board 58 effectively iced the match:"

        "text": "In the Open Room, North's descriptive raise helped Klukowski find the successful sacrifice, despite his unfavorable vulnerability. Knowing that a spade void lay on his left, he despaired of his chance of defeating four hearts. Saving rated to score no worse than a 1- or 2-imp loss, and it had more to gain if nine tricks were available or the opponents guessed wrongly. (If Kalita produced no tricks, four spades could have proven costly, but in that case the opponents would have a slam unless East held a defensive trick that was worthless to Klukowski.) Here, Kalita produced two tricks for his partner; minus 200 meant 6 imps to ZIMMERMANN when East-West at the other table lacked the information to bid over four hearts.\n\nSTREET won 13 imps on the penultimate deal when Pachtmann and Zatorski defended a game better than Kalita and Klukowski, but it was too little too late. The final deal saw ZIMMERMANN win an overtrick imp. Although STREET took the quarter 30-28, ZIMMERMANN prevailed by 25 imps 108-83.\n\n**Summary**\n\nCongratulations to Sjoert Brink, Bas Drijver, Jacek Kalita, Michal Klukowski, Michal Nowosadzki, and Pierre Zimmermann for a deserved win in the 2023 Soloway, the latest title for the most successful squad in recent years. Condolences to the STREET players on a hard-fought loss, though not as much of a nail-biter as the last time these teams met in a major knockout final. This runner-up finish marks STREET's third second place in five premier American knockouts—in addition to wins in lesser national events—a rare achievement in its own right. It would surprise no one to see this team holding one of the major cups before too long."

It seems to me that Avarelli made a good bid, but, for all I know, takeout doubles of one diamond without any spades may be de rigueur in the Roman Club System. I know that editor Moyse believes in this sort of thing, and I can only hope that he learns from this horrible (and somewhat unlucky) example. Incidentally, the story would have had a happy ending (for the Italians) if [the redoubler] had taken out to five clubs or five diamonds. It must have been an authoritative double."

        "text": "**Editorial**\n\n**Ring in the New**\n\nAlong with 1998, we welcome to The Bridge World staff Associate Editor Phillip Alder. An Englishman by birth who now lives in Florida, he brings outstanding credentials to his new position: one of the world's leading syndicated columnists, author or co-author of successful books in several areas of bridge, and a former editor of Bridge Magazine. Some of his articles have appeared in our pages.\n\nPhillip's main area of responsibility will be Challenge the Champs, where he recently appeared as a contestant. Subscribers have had to read (suffer?) the views of Kaplan and Rubens in this column for thirty years; it's high time they were given the opportunity to endure a different set of biases. The beginning of Alder's tenure also marks a change in the editorial policy governing the department: To increase the relevance of the descriptions for most readers, the text for each deal will include a possible approach to the auction using Bridge World Standard. In most cases, a third (\"standard\") auction, or beginning of an auction, will be presented. This adjustment will hold sway during a trial period, while readers' comments are evaluated.\n\nThe new year will also usher in minor changes in the Master Solvers' Club, where we are dropping several not-too-popular statistics: the \"Solvers' Percentage,\" for which it is too difficult to obtain anything near a random sample while maintaining the magazine's production schedule; the \"Experts' Honor Roll,\" the purpose of which continues to be misinterpreted despite repeated in-print explanations; and, correspondingly, the Experts' and Solvers' averages.\n\nThis issue marks the first absence of Rate Your Own Game in over 25 years. The editor has nostalgic feelings about this column, but only a handful of readers bewailed its pending departure, proposed in September. To avoid closing the door too firmly, we will if possible include an occasional article of this type in response to suggestions to present an idea or area of bidding not already covered by the department.\n\nTo make way for other series, the Swiss Match scheduled for this issue has been postponed. Our current expectation is that it will appear in the April issue.\n\n*     *     *\n\n**New Location; New Facilities**\n\nThe Bridge World has relocated to the suburbs, moving out of Manhattan for the first time in its almost-seventy-year history. Our new address is 717 White Plains Road, Suite 106, Scarsdale, NY 10583-5009. There is no accommodation for walk-in ordering or purchasing there; nonetheless, we intend to improve our level of service dramatically—aiming at that achieved when the late Betty Kaplan ran the office, a very high goal indeed—in part"

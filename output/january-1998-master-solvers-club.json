I assume that too many opponents bid too much.\n\nRichmond partners may think I should start with three clubs. In \"Weak Twos in Diamonds\", my article in the March issue, I refer to one level holds and double jumps as strong (preemptively).\n\nWe shouldn't be able to make four clubs. Maybe if I bid four hearts they would bid four spades, so I'm going to slam their suit. They're very unlikely to slam, and if they do, I expect to be on lead (if we defend), and they don't rate to make grand slam.\n\nIt's more likely that RHO will be de-clarer, so that you will be on lead. Are you contemplating fourth from your longest and strongest?\n\nBOB ROWELL: \"Four diamonds. Preempts would be a good save, unless part-ner to raise with a fit, but leaves East-West room to have an accident.\""

However, in 1957, when Edgar came the McKenney Trophy with what was then considered an astronomical masterpoint total (chicken feed in today), the was regarded as a premier event. And the contest for winning the most master-points in a year (then called the McKenney; now named after Barry Crane) was regarded as significant; indeed the resulting scramble to accumulate points apparently tainted the game of bridge for the U.S. In the closed Room, West doubled five clubs, the inevitable terminal auction played a step of the scramble.

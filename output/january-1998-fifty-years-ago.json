Then, if North ruffed with the king of hearts and returned a trump, the eight of hearts would be the necessary entry to the ace of spades, declarer's tenth trick. Eventually, Zia did play a diamond and we thought he would make the contract, but he went wrong and ruffed low. Now, he could not successfully follow the line of play described above, because North could ruff high and kill dummy with a trump return. Instead, Zia ruffed a club and led the last diamond. Had Perron made the mistake of ruffing low, Zia could have overruffed, led a spade to dummy, and scored his last trump en passant. However, Perron correctly discarded his last spade on the diamond, and Zia was down one. A fascinating deal. The U. S. was lucky to split the board. In the Closed Room, the French judged badly and arrived at three spades, which was set one trick."

        "text": "**Fifty Years Ago**\n\nMany of the top players of fifty years ago had a great flair for card play. Often, they seemed to conjure up a brilliant line of play or defense with little or no calculation, as though through intuition or inspiration. No one exemplified the instinctive player more, in quality or quantity of superior plays, than Harry Fishbein. This Fishbein exploit, from the team-of-four event at the 1947 Winter Nationals, was reported in the Jaunary, 1948, issue of The Bridge World."

The defense attacked spades, and most Souths discarded diamonds on the second and third rounds of the suit, keeping control—except that hearts broke five-one so the contract was defeated.\n\nFishbein was the only South to make four hearts. He ruffed the second spade, cashed two clubs, and crossruffed for ten tricks. Notice that discarding at tricks two and three relies on better than five-one breaks in two suits, hearts and clubs, while the winning line requires only one decent break, in clubs. Still, we doubt that Fishy calculated the exact odds.\n\nTerence Reese broke new ground by"

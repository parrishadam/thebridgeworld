        "text": "**Fifty Years Ago**\n\nMany of the top players of 1947 years ago had a great flair for card play. Often, they seemed to conjure up a brilliant line of play or defense with little or no calculation, as though a little birdie whispered in their ears. Four hearts was a popular contract around the room. The defense attacked spades, and most Souths discarded diamonds on the second and third rounds of the suit, keeping control—except that hearts broke five-one so the contract could not be made\n\nFishbein was the only South to make four hearts. He ruffed the second spade, cashed two clubs, and crossruffed for ten tricks. Notice that discarding at trick two and three relies on better than five-one breaks in two suits; hearts and clubs, while the winning line requires only one decent break in clubs. Still, we doubt that Fishbein calculated the exact odds."

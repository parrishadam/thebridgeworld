To have a chance, you need a six-two or five-three split.\n\nIf the split is six-two, continuing with the jack picks up five nine-doubletons with either defender. Leading the eight to the second round does twice as well, winning against 10 royal-doubletons with either defender. Leading the eight does better overall by 10 six-two cases.\n\nIf the split is five-three, it is much better to continue with the jack followed by the ten. That line succeeds if either defender was dealt either nine-third (10 cases) or honor-nine-third (10 cases, for 20 total cases). In contrast, continuing with the eight on the second (or third) round gains only if either defender started with king-queen-low (five cases). Playing the suit from the top is better than continuing with the eight by 30 five-three cases, far more likely than the 10 six-two cases in which the eight at trick two is the winner."

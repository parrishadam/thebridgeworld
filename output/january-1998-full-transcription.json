One nice feature of this perspective is that you get the advantages of being a spectator, yet can openly discuss the deal as it is being played, gaining additional insights from the observations of others. Of course, anyone who can see all four hands must take great care not to let knowledge of the layout affect his analysis or evaluation of the players' actions.\n\nIn Tunisia, the smart money made three teams roughly equal co-favorites to win the Bowl: France and the two United States entries. This time, the smart money was smart indeed. All three teams reached the semifinals, and France defeated USA-2 narrowly in the final. This report follows the 20-board-match between France and USA-1 in the qualifying round-robin, one of the most interesting I have ever seen, from the position of a Vu-Graph observer. I emphasize my thoughts as I was watching and discussing the match. To preserve the flavor of an actual Vu-Graph show, we override the usual Bridge World procedure of making South the declarer when possible and instead leave the players in their fixed geographical positions throughout the article: For the U. S., Michael Rosenberg was West and Mahmood Zia East; for France, Paul Chemla was South and Michel Perron North."

Some play that three-of-a-major shows a weak five-five (three-heart bid) or a weak six-four (three-spade bid). Holding a game force, opener transfers with an artificial three clubs and then bids three-of-a-major, forcing.\n\nJEFF RUBENS (and PHILLIP ALDER similarly): \"Two notrump. I reject two spades. Among the other choices, all seriously flawed, two notrump has the best recovery chances should I be naming the wrong strain.\"\n\nMICHAEL ROSENBERG (and JOHN CARRUTHERS similarly): \"Two notrump. If partner bids three of a major, raise to four. If partner bids three clubs, bid three notrump. If partner bids three diamonds, bid five clubs (super-cue). Finally, if partner bids three notrump (presumably 5=4=2=2), bid four diamonds, offering a choice between the majors and showing diamond values (obviously with three low clubs, else I would pass three notrump).\"\n\nAnd now, the shudders.\n\nHENRY BETHE: \"Two spades. If partner can bid again, I can show the hearts and get to game or even, over three diamonds, reach slam. The problem with three hearts is that it is too committal as to strain, and I'm not at all sure.\"\n\nReaching slam after that start would be a first.\n\nBILLY EISENBERG: \"Two spades. The old mark-time bid.\"\n\nBut you'd mark the same time if the king-queen of hearts were the three-deuce.\n\nAL ROTH: \"Two spades. I must miss a game once in a while, but I don't mind missing a non-vul. game. However, partner may bid again—and if so, I will get to game.\"\n\nSounds as if he forgot the usual, \"if I just get by this round.\"\n\nERIC RODWELL: \"Two spades. Very close between two spades and two notrump. Three notrump is good opposite, ♠ K Q 10 x x ♥ A J x x ♦ x ♣ K J x, but not opposite, ♠ A K x x x ♥ A J x x ♦ x x ♣ Q x, or less. Two spades gives partner another chance, and we are not vulnerable.\"\n\nNow that's interesting. Rodwell considers trying for game opposite one of his openings, while Roth, Mr. Strong One-Bid himself, is happy to bid only two spades.\n\nCHIP MARTEL: \"Two spades. While you have a lot of high cards, you aren't likely to make a game. Give partner, ♠ A K x x x ♥ A J x x ♦ J x ♣ K x, and no game is very good.\"\n\nMARK BARTUSEK: \"Two spades. I'll be conservative, as only a non-vul. game is at stake. I don't particularly like three hearts or three spades, but two notrump is worth considering because partner might pattern out on the way to game.\"\n\nHe can pattern out over two spades just as easily.\n\nMARSHALL MILES: \"Two spades. Partner's most likely distribution is 5=4=1=3, in which case my hand isn't worth much. But I've got to keep the bidding open, just in case partner has a decent hand.\"\n\nOnly one panelist didn't want to keep the bidding open.\n\nJOHN LOWENTHAL: \"Pass.

        "text": "After a trump lead, declarer, Chemla, drew another round of trumps and tried ace and king of clubs, which seems like a reasonable line. I was wondering if it might not be better immediately to play the ace and king of hearts, continuing with a heart ruff high if an honor fell on the second round. If both heart honors come down, the contract will then be cold regardless of the black-suit splits. However, this approach loses on some four-one club splits when the actual line of play would have succeeded, such as when a defender holds two trumps and one club. Perhaps the answer depends on how often it will occur to the defenders to dump a heart honor on the second round of hearts and thus deflect declarer to a losing line of play. Another possible improvement for South is to cash a high club at trick two. Then, if the club queen drops, heart ace, heart ruff high, diamond ace, heart ruff high, spade nine to dummy, draw trumps, club jack, diamond king, club king. On the lie of the cards, all plays were booked for success, so the result was duplicated."

Notice that discarding at tricks two and three relies on better than five-one breaks in two suits, hearts and clubs, while the winning line requires only one decent break, in clubs.

On the bidding, South figured to have six spades, so the French declarer chose to play North for the queen of clubs. This gave the U. S. a favorable swing that could have been just as large a loss."

Although he was not the sole inventor of any techniques, Edgar brought new dimensions to both varieties. To the \"good deals\" type, he added the common-theme approach nowadays typically applied in non-reportorial articles. For an illustration, let's look at some snatches from the thematic report of his atypical triumph in the Individual, from the March, 1957, issue of The Bridge World."

The upheaval in bridge journalism began less than two years after \"New Science\" had begun to revolutionize table behavior. It was less dramatic, but its effects were equally long lasting.\n\nIn his first big-time tournament report, arguably the best ever, Edgar used a box-score approach, daring to record his view of the exact effectiveness of each of the participants in the match between Italy and the United States that decided the 1958 Bermuda Bowl. Every educated person should be familiar with the entire document, which extended over five issues of The Bridge World (beginning in September, 1958), but here you'll have to settle for an abridgement that tries to preserve the flavor of the original.

I kept two of these \"Act of God\" columns, one for each team, and with all the results in, comparison would show if one team was substantially luckier than the other.\n\nThe final tabulation shows three types of notations in each player's column: charges for errors, credits for brilliance, and black marks for uncharged errors. The net figure is the player's total IMP charges, less IMP credits, plus (for I am a purist) a one-point charge for each black mark. This net figure, divided by the number of boards played, gives a fraction—actually, the number of IMP lost per board played—which, in my opinion, is a reliable index of general effectiveness.\n\nSince this article will take the form of analysis of each player's performance, it will, inevitably, deal more with personalities than is the custom in bridge reports. I make no apology for this. My team has not done well enough to give us a chance to play for the U.S. next year; I am not in a glass house, and so I can afford to throw stones. But it is only fair to emphasize the obvious: opportunities for brilliance are few; for error, countless. In addition to the few brilliancies and many errors reported here, each player made thousands of sound, accurate decisions which go unheralded because the right play or bid is unspectacular."

But they were clearly the best pair around this year.\n\nMy estimate is that fairly good play will lose one IMP every four boards. Par, then, is .250 (and it is not common to play well under the pressure of the World Championship match). So the record of Belladonna and Avarelli as a pair is truly remarkable.\n\nThere were very few charges against them. . . . Their system cost Belladonna and Avarelli a small loss on Deal 94 when they reached the wrong partial, but almost all of their infrequent bidding troubles seemed to arise after takeout doubles. . . . a fourth occurred on Deal 68:"

When this held he gave Forquet a diamond ruff, was put back in by the marked underlead in clubs to his queen, and gave Forquet another ruff to set the contract. Nicely done.\n\nOf course Stone had made the defense easier than was necessary. Instead of playing a club from dummy he should ruff a spade and play the heart king. To beat the contract now Forquet must lead the club jack to be overtaken by the queen, and after ruffing a diamond must underlead again on the mere chance of finding West with the club ten.\n\nIt was ungenerous of Stone not to give Forquet the opportunity for such brilliance."

Three diamonds showed a minimum, so Nilsland terminated any further investigation.\n\nThe Swedes said afterwards that either West shouldn't open a non-opening bid or East shouldn't force to game. That's true, but many pairs would be in game at IMPs. Switch West's hearts and clubs and four spades is acceptable.\n\nThe Newcomers did well when Lars, West, despite his fitting king of diamonds, opted not to move over two spades. This ostensibly remarkable decision was based on real-world tactical considerations. With a fit, the Danes prefer not to pass out a passed-hand one-level response, fearing this would make entry into the auction too easy for the opponents. Thus, there was only the mildest of inferences that East did not have a rock-bottom minimum hand. (This is not to say that Lars' decision was right. It seems mighty conservative to me anyway.)\n\nBWS auction: pass — one diamond — one spade — pass.\n\nAwards: 3 ♠ 10; 2 NT 7; 3 NT 4; 4 ♠ 3."

        "text": "Forquet cashed two top spades and then led the ten of spades for partner to trump. Siniscalco did not give Forquet the club ruff he was angling for, but Becker had to lose a club anyway, for down 300. Since four spades was doubled and set 200 at the other table, the U. S. lost 500 points—six IMP.\n\nNow, I don't admire Becker's two-heart opening, but I have charged the whole loss to Crawford. The vagueness of the requirements for a weak two-bid and the liberties taken within even these hazy limits cause many a loss. But why here? It seems to me that Crawford should expect to beat four spades, perhaps a lot; and just as clearly he should expect five hearts to go down, no matter what sort of two-heart bid partner has. A decision like that five-heart bid can be justified only by success, and this one wasn't so justified.\n\n*\n\nIn general, Crawford's performance, especially in the first half of the match, was astonishing. Some of his errors were of the sort you just don't expect from one of the world's greatest players. . . . And on Deal 64, non-vulnerable against vulnerable, he held:\n\n♠ K 6 ♥ Q 4 2 ♦ K 7 6 4 3 2 ♣ J 7.\n\nOne club (artificial, strong) was opened at his left; pass from partner; two clubs (artificial, strong) at his right. \"Three diamonds,\" bid Crawford, undaunted by the minimum of 17 points at his left, and an ace and a king or three kings at his right. Down 1300. It's hard to believe.\n\nHowever, most of Crawford's charges are far more reasonable, . . . I have more sympathy for Crawford and"

(Still, if West's red-suit king is in diamonds, seven clubs is a highly desirable contract.)\n\nWhen the Newcomers have agreed a minor, they telescope the responses to Roman Key-Card Blackwood. So, five diamonds announced two key cards without the queen of clubs; six hearts showed that king, simultaneously denying the king of diamonds. The queen of spades, rather than the queen of diamonds, was a lucky bonus.\n\nBWS auction: It would be ideal to have West use RKCB.

        "text": "Fallenius' two-heart opening showed four hearts and a longer minor with 10-13 points. In response to two relays, he described a maximum with clubs and only four-five in the two suits. Four diamonds was natural, five clubs a cuebid that denied any major-suit controls.\n\nThe Newcomers have an interesting agreement. One spade was fourth-suit forcing, but a jump to two spades instead would have been a game-force with four hearts. So, when Morten jumped to three hearts, he was known to have only three. Via two doses of RKCB, Morten learned that his brother had one key card and the queen of hearts but no side king.\n\nBWS auction: one club [?] — one diamond — one heart — one spade — one notrump — three hearts — three notrump — six notrump — pass.\n\nAwards: 6 NT (West) 10; 6 NT (East) 8; 6♥ (West) 7; 6♥ (East), 6♦, 6♠ 5; 5 NT 3; 5♥ 2; 5♠, 5♦ 1."

However, East felt that this denied a heart holding as good as ace-king, so he didn't think seven was feasible. (Still, if West's red-suit king is in diamonds, seven clubs is a highly desirable contract.)\n\nWhen the Newcomers have agreed a minor, they telescope the responses to Roman Key-Card Blackwood. So, five diamonds announced two key cards without the queen of clubs; six hearts showed that king, simultaneously denying the king of diamonds. The queen of spades, rather than the queen of diamonds, was a lucky bonus.\n\nBWS auction: It would be ideal to have West use RKCB. (But how?)"

In response to two relays, he described a maximum with clubs and only four-five in the two suits. Four diamonds was natural, five clubs a cuebid that denied any major-suit controls.\n\nThe Newcomers have an interesting agreement. One spade was fourth-suit forcing, but a jump to two spades instead would have been a game-force with four hearts. So, when Morten jumped to three hearts, he was known to have only three. Via two doses of RKCB, Morten learned that his brother had one key card and the queen of hearts but no side king.\n\nBWS auction: one club [?] — one diamond — one heart — one spade — one notrump — three hearts — three notrump — six notrump — pass."

The Incumbents, trying for their fourth victory toward a place in the Challenge of the Decade, are Bjorn Fallenius and Mats Nilsland from Sweden. Well, Fallenius is Swedish by birth, but now he lives primarily in New York City. They use a strong-club system with five-card majors, 14-16 notrump and a nebulous one diamond. When holding at least game-going values, they usually ascend into a relay auction.\n\nThe Newcomers are brothers Lars and Morten Lund Madsen. Both are students at Copenhagen University, Lars studying economics and Morten mathematics. They were the mainstays of the Danish team that won last year's World Junior Championship, and have had several medal-winning performances in European junior events. However, Lars, at 25, is too old for further success at that level. Morten, at 23, has two more years of eligibility. The Danes use an Acol-style system but with five-card one-spade openings. They employ a variable notrump (11-14 nonvul., 15-17 vul.) and, most unusually for Europeans, weak two-bids in three suits.\n\nOur thanks to these readers who sent deals used in this match: John Uchida, Seattle, Deal 2; Michael Whitman, San Francisco, Deal 3; Martin Miller, Rochester, NY, Deal 4; L.

Technically, the match was on a very high plane indeed—there were few errors of dummy play or defense; of these few, not more than three or four were really glaring. And the bidding errors were generally ones involving fine judgment, not gross overbids or underbids.\n\nSlam bidding was the worst department for both teams. The U.S. bid twelve slams—five made, seven went down. We missed four good slams that would have made, and one good one that wouldn't. One of the U.S. slams that made should have been beaten; conversely, one of those beaten should have been made. All in all, a miserable showing.\n\nThe Italians were no better. They bid only eight slams—four made, four didn't. That looks almost respectable, but they missed five good slams, and, of the four they bid and made, two were in the wrong contract and one should have been beaten. One of the slams they bid and went down on was a good contract, but they luckily stayed out of another good one that only failed because of stacked cards.\n\nI came to no conclusions about the \"battle of the systems.\" Somehow, there were very few strictly systemic swings—either pickups or losses—for the Neapolitan or Roman systems. Roth-Stone seemed to have quite a few systemic losses, but the results are inconclusive. The other Americans did fairly well with psychics, unimpressively with preempts, jump overcalls, disastrously with weak two-bids. I saw no signs that anyone was losing points through unfamiliarity with the meaning of his opponents' bidding. The swings were due to judgment, rarely to system at all.\n\nOver the long match luck was fairly even. The Americans lost, on my reckoning, 51 IMP through unlucky swings. They gained 44 IMP in lucky ones. (By luck, I mean good contracts going down, bad ones making; slams on finesses, guess situations on lead, etc.) We were, then, slightly unlucky, but not enough to make the difference.\n\nWe lost because we were outplayed; we did a few more good things than the Italians did, but a lot more bad things.

Accordingly, a current trend is the use of a direct double raise of a major with hands weaker than limit-raise strength. This, in turn has led to a search for alternative mechanisms for the limit raise. A common solution has been to devote the entire range from two of opener's major to three of opener's major to raises. Using so many bids for this purpose is not productive; my proposal, below, avoids this waste."

Opener rebids as follows:\n\n*Three clubs:* Six or more losers; a minimum. In effect, this says, \"I may be passing a limit raise.\" [If responder rebids three diamonds, a strong relay, opener shows his distribution using the \"higher-bid scheme\" for bids of three hearts or higher, shown below. Alternatively, responder may bid three of opener's major to show a limit raise, bid the other major to show six losers and some singleton (opener can relay to discover the short suit), or make a higher new-suit bid to show concentrated values in a hand marginally worth a slam try.]\n\n*Three diamonds:* Key-card Blackwood.

How they must frequently yearn to change a card or two, or a call or play, to purify a deal of its real-world flaws. This hindrance reduces the flavor of some of the articles in **The Times Book of Bridge** (Batsford; 112 pages; $13.95 paperbound), an eclectic collection of Robert Sheehan's work for *The Times* of London. Despite this drawback and some unevenness in level of topic sophistication and depth of analysis, we think most avid bridge readers, especially non-Britons, will find the book worthwhile. Warts and all, the deals have points of interest. Sheehan, one of the current generation's most successful European competitors, has a good eye for what serious players will find intriguing. Several problem situations present fresh challenges. We singled out non-Britons above because the parts of the book we liked best were those that revolved around in-depth portraits of several of the leading British bridge personalities, both alive and dead. Some of the deals and anecdotes in those chapters were new to us, and the section on the late Irving Rose sparkled brightly enough to provide sufficient light for an entire book.\n\nAvailable from The Bookshelf [TIMES]\n\n*                    *                    *"

        "text": "On the surface, Alan Mould's **\"Preempts\"** (Batsford; 143 pages; $16.95 paperback) is designed to present the fundamental techniques of opening and responding to preemptives, to describe today's widely varying styles and the tradeoffs among them, to create awareness of the opportunities for obstructive tactics other than openings, and to add occasional observations and personal comments about which choices of approach and method seem to the author more or less likely to be successful.\n\nThis book does all that, but . . . surprise! The best part is a large, excellently presented, theoretical section on card values, how to judge whether your strength is offensive or defensive, comparison of risks and rewards—in short, just the sort of knowledge one needs to advance from formula follower to intelligent bidder. This discussion is simple, easy to follow, and right on target. It is introduced in the context of deciding whether or not to open a three-bid, and thus is mildly mislabeled (because it applies much more generally), but this part alone is worth the price of the book to an improving player. That's two winners for Mould's commonsense approach to advanced bidding topics; his book on slam bidding has similar positive characteristics.\n\nAvailable from The Bookshelf [PRE]\n\n*        *        *"

This theme is handled well, especially in the 36 quiz deals that augment the lessons and numerous individual suit discussions. The tutorial level is elementary to low intermediate, but most of the quiz deals stretch to greater challenges. Overall, the book is good, but we cannot give it our highest recommendation because the authors goof in a few places, messing up an occasional analysis while trying to set up the desired theme.

He made it with an overtrick too, because the spades split; but of course the Italians bid four hearts at the other table and made it easily. Who was responsible for the four IMP loss?\n\nRoth's jump overcall is certainly atypical, but I don't think it is unreasonable on this vulnerability, facing a passed hand. Obviously, he must have felt that the hand belonged to the enemy and that it was worth a little risk to disrupt their communications. Probably the danger of his missing four hearts never occurred to him. Personally, I consider Stone to be the guilty party. Granted that he believes in \"sound\" opening bids; surely he could \"take his life in his hands\" and open this holding."

But in each case opener carried on to three notrump with a skinny minimum opening, clearly hoping for a strictly \"Roth-Stone\" passed hand of 13 points or better. The result? Down one; down one. Six IMP lost.\n\nDo you suppose that opener went on in these instances because he hadn't opened a very light \"third-hand\" bid? But Roth and Stone weren't opening light hands in third or fourth seat. Stone passed, third-hand:\n\n♠ A 6 3 ♥ Q J 9 4 ♦ A 8 6 ♣ 7 6 4\n\nAnd Roth, fourth-hand, passed out:\n\n♠ 10 8 6 5 ♥ A 10 9 ♦ A 6 ♣ K 9 5 4\n\nMaybe I'm wrong, but it seems to me that either hand above might make game opposite the sort of monsters they pass in first and second seat.

Crawford's rebid is a problem—perhaps a two-spade underbid or a three-spade overbid would be better, but two clubs looks all right. And by now the Americans were on the hook, for no one wanted to bid notrump without a heart stopper. Oh, Becker might bid two diamonds, not three clubs; Crawford might bid three, not four, spades. But I'm not sure it would help. A bad hand for Old Science.\n\nOn Deal 29 this pair, having a sort of heart stopper this time, decided to play notrump. [See top of next column.]"

Becker had to guess whether to put in his nine or his queen, and he went wrong—he chose the queen, and the Italians cashed five heart tricks, for down one.\n\nActually, I think Becker's play is correct. If the hearts are 4-4, or if East has five, Becker's play makes relatively little difference; only if the lead was from three is it crucial. And a lead from three to a jack seems a little more attractive than from three to an ace. [In contrast, if you assume a heart would always be led, it is twice as likely that the opening leader's honor is not the jack than that it is.—J.R.]\n\nThe Italians also played three notrump, but South, with two little hearts, was declarer. With a small heart lead, declarer has no option—he must put in the nine. So Italy picked up a lucky nine IMP by playing from the \"wrong\" side.\n\nBut it wasn't all luck; five diamonds is on ice, and at IMP scoring there is little excuse for being in notrump. Surely Crawford should have contrived to show his diamond fit."

This resulted, it may be recalled, in a five club sacrifice, down 700, when five diamonds might well have been made.\n\nI charged Rapée with a substantial loss, but I have sympathy for his bid. The alternative is to pass (planning on backing in later with an unusual notrump overcall), and it seems to me that, first-hand in this vulnerability situation, the terribly weak freak holding calls for some sort of drastic preemptive action.\n\nRapée played a very active style in Como; he was always on the move, trying to create favorable swings; yet this was the only one of his \"operations\" that ended in American disaster. He psyched repeatedly and was never punished. On Deal 130 he jostled the Italians into a six-spade contract that needed a 3-3 trump split—they got it—while the Americans played in a cold six-diamond spot after an unimpeded auction; and on Deals 108 and 140, previously discussed, his psychics gained heavily. Moreover, the unsettling effect on opponents should not be discounted.\n\n*\n\nI charged Rapée for the rather ludicrous result on Deal 139:"

Although we, too, prefer this gadget, we are much too nice to complain.\n\nSome preferred a four-diamond splinter.\n\nMARY & MAX HARDY: \"Four diamonds. In our methods, we use concealed splinters.

I wish I were slightly stronger, but partner doesn't need much for a slam if his hand fits mine, especially if he has a singleton spade.\"\n\nThat is the problem with four diamonds. Although you are barely of minimum strength, an attractive pattern opposite (short spades, not short clubs) is the key to this hand. Four diamonds, two notrump and four hearts do nothing to discover the solution of the spade-club mystery. Additionally, we do not like to splinter with all of our values in one suit. We consider a typical splinter to be more spread out.\n\nSeveral rejected four diamonds in favor of two notrump.\n\nCHIP MARTEL: \"Two notrump. Better hand for a fit-showing jump. However, since neither that nor my own method (where three clubs is a good four-card single raise) is BWS, I'll settle for two notrump (planning to drive to four hearts). Four diamonds is a bit too much for me, particularly since it gives partner no space to wiggle.\"\n\nJEFF RUBENS: \"Two notrump.

Chemla overruffed and returned a trump. It might seem as though Zia can make the contract by ducking, but a spade return from North would leave declarer a trick short.

I was surprised that declarer didn't duck the second round also, which would have put even more pressure on Rosenberg to find safe discards. Guided by Zia's order of play in clubs (with spade strength, Zia would have played king-then-queen), Rosenberg discarded a heart. Chemla cashed ace of diamonds and ace-king of spades, then led a diamond. Had he known that diamonds were four-one, he would have ducked; not knowing, he went up with dummy's king and was in trouble. Having no other hope, declarer continued with the queen and another diamond. East carelessly kept his remaining spade. This convinced Rosenberg that declarer had a third spade, and, as we American rooters watched in horror, Rosenberg played a spade, giving declarer the contract. This was a big swing, as the U. S. stopped safely in three diamonds.\n\nOn Board 10, Zia, with jack-seven of clubs in the closed hand opposite king-eight-six-four in dummy, announced a claim that included a statement that he would play his LHO for the ace of clubs. LHO's actual holding was singleton ace. I was curious about what the ruling might have been if the defender had happened to hold the singleton queen of clubs. Would declarer have been assumed to have led a low club toward the king, or could he be forced to lead the jack after the claim?\n\nBoth sides reached a good grand slam in spades with,"

Chemla ducked the king of diamonds and won the diamond continuation, Rosenberg retaining his queen. When declarer led the jack of hearts, covered by the queen and ace, it looked to me as though Chemla could count out Rosenberg's hand, cash the ace of clubs, and endplay him with the third spade for down one. In fact, declarer did cash the ace of clubs, but then he continued with the queen. There were some very nervous moments as Zia considered ducking this trick, which would have allowed declarer to revert to the endplay. At last, Zia won with his king, Rosenberg pitched a heart, and the diamond return set the contract two tricks. This board was a push, as the U. S. was in three hearts, down two, in the Closed Room.\n\nThe next deal showed off \"declarer's advantage\" by demonstrating how difficult it can be to defend effectively at the beginning of the play when few clues are available."

For each gift you give, you will get a book for yourself.\n\nAre we giving you the impression that we are trying harder? Can you suggest other ways in which we can improve? Please let us know."

An Englishman by birth who now lives in Florida, he brings outstanding credentials to his new position: one of the world's leading syndicated columnists, author or co-author of successful books in several areas of bridge, and a former editor of *Bridge Magazine*. Some of his articles have appeared in our pages.\n\nPhillip's main area of responsibility will be *Challenge the Champs*, where he recently appeared as a contestant. Subscribers have had to read (suffer?) the views of Kaplan and Rubens in this column for thirty years; it's high time they were given the opportunity to endure a different set of biases. The beginning of Alder's tenure also marks a change in the editorial policy governing the department: To increase the relevance of the descriptions for most readers, the text for each deal will include a possible approach to the auction using Bridge World Standard. In most cases, a third (\"standard\") auction, or beginning of an auction, will be presented. This adjustment will hold sway during a trial period, while readers' comments are evaluated.\n\nThe new year will also usher in minor changes in the *Master Solvers' Club*, where we are dropping several not-too-popular statistics: the \"Solvers' Percentage,\" for which it is too difficult to obtain anything near a random sample while maintaining the magazine's production schedule; the \"Experts' Honor Roll,\" the purpose of which continues to be misinterpreted despite repeated in-print explanations; and, correspondingly, the Experts' and Solvers' averages.\n\nThis issue marks the first absence of *Rate Your Own Game* in over 25 years. The editor has nostalgic feelings about this column, but only a handful of readers bewailed its pending departure, proposed in September. To avoid closing the door too firmly, we will if possible include an occasional article of this type in response to suggestions to present an idea or area of bidding not already covered by the department.\n\nTo make way for other series, the *Swiss Match* scheduled for this issue has been postponed. Our current expectation is that it will appear in the April issue.\n\n* * *\n\n**New Location; New Facilities**\n\n*The Bridge World* has relocated to the suburbs, moving out of Manhattan for the first time in its almost-seventy-year history. Our new address is 717 White Plains Road, Suite 106, Scarsdale, NY 10583-5009. There is no accommodation for walk-in ordering or purchasing there; nonetheless, we intend to improve our level of service dramatically—aiming at that achieved when the late Betty Kaplan ran the office, a very high goal indeed—in part"

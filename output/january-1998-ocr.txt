trick two. This lets you keep all-around
control, in effect to get the fourth round
of trumps played when it is convenient.
You plan to win the (say, red-suit) re-
turn, ruff a club, cross to hand with a
trump, ruff a second club, return to the
other red suit, draw trumps and claim.
Only a red-suit void or a horrific club
split will doom this plan. Note that you
would be slightly more exposed to a
ruff or an overruff if you trumped any
clubs before losing a spade trick.

East can keep only three cards. If he

started with the sole guard in diamonds
and clubs (as in the diagram), he will
have been squeezed. You guess the suit
he has unguarded, then cash the ace of
that suit to take the rest of the tricks.

However, that line of play is overly
optimistic. West cannot be expected to
behave like a trained seal. He can tell,
just as well as you, that East’s hand
looks something like 1=0=6=6. Given
the opportunity, a competent West will
shift to a club at trick two; bye bye
squeeze!

A better try is to win with the heart
ace and run spades, to reach:

Assuming East has the sole minor-

suit guards, he will have been
squeezed. As in the standard criss-cross
squeeze, described above, you must
guess his shape. if East has reduced to
two or fewer diamonds, you play on
diamonds to make an overtrick. Other-
wise, East has at most two clubs; you
continue with club ace, diamond king,
club, to set up the dummy.

The View from Vu-Graph

by Kit Woolsey, Kensington, CA

As the coach of the USA-1
team in the 1997 Bermuda Bowl,
played during October in Tunisia, I had
many opportunities to watch matches
on the Vu-Graph. One nice feature of
this perspective is that you get the ad-
vantages of being a spectator, yet can
openly discuss the deal as it is being
played, gaining additional insights from
the observations of others. Of course,
anyone who can see all four hands must
take great care not to let knowledge of
the layout affect his analysis or evalu-
ation of the players’ actions.

In Tunisia, the smart money made
three teams roughly equal co-favorites
to win the Bowl: France and the two
United States entries. This time, the
smart money was smart indeed. All

three teams reached the semifinals, and
France defeated USA-2 narrowly in the
final. This report follows the 20-board-
match between France and USA-1 in
the qualifying round-robin, one of the
most interesting I have ever seen, from
the position of a Vu-Graph observer. I
emphasize my thoughts as I was watch-
ing and discussing the match. To pre-
serve the flavor of an actual Vu-Graph
show, we override the usual Bridge
World procedure of making South the
declarer when possible and instead
leave the players in their fixed geo-
graphical positions throughout the arti-
cle: For the U. S., Michael Rosenberg
was West and Mahmood Zia East; for
France, Paul Chemla was South and
Michel Perron North.

these days) to enlighten us about Al
Sobel. Another famous director, Harry
Goldwater, had a rule to accept all leads
out of turn because any player who isn’t
smart enough to know whose lead it is
certainly isn’t smart enough to make
the best opening lead. Here, however,
you surely don’t want to accept a heart
lead from RHO—you might as well
tear up your queen.

RON GERARD: “‘c. Who needs this agita?
(a) and (b) are clearly wrong and (e) is
pointless; (d) runs the risk of drawing a
club lead. I expect something like,

&AKQ1IOxxx YVKx Oxx #Ax.

But please don’t force me to waste mental
energy on this stuff.”’

Ouch!

Amidst all the grumpiness, there was
a panelist who thought there might be
some subterfuge afoot.

MAHMOooD ZIA: “‘d. East is the Rueful
Rabbit holding ace-queen-jack-ten-low of
clubs and finding the only lead out of turn
to beat this!”

Bossy WOLFF: “‘c. A great problem with
a real guess by us. I’m hoping for ace-low,
not king-low, in hearts from partner. The
two-heart bidder may have a solid club
suit, with dummy having solid spades.”’

Solid clubs aren’t likely, but we still
see no reason to give the defense a
chance to lead that suit. We know that
we have at least one, and probably two,
heart stoppers, and positionally we
think a heart lead from West is fine. A
majority agree:

CARL HUDECEK: “‘c. I don’t mind a heart

lead knowing RHO has only low one(s). I
prefer to have West lead the heart.”’

CurP MARTEL: “‘c. It’s hard to see how it
can be better to have East lead hearts rather

55

than West, so a and b are out. Also, why
have the heart eight as a penalty card?”

Kit Woo .sey: “‘c. This puts me even
with the field, except when West has a
surprise club lead—then I gain. Partner
should have something in hearts to bid
three notrump (he could have bid three
hearts otherwise), so I can’t mind the heart
lead too much.”’

MARSHALL MILES (with MARK BaAr-
TUSEK and HENRY BETHE similarly): “‘c. I
suspect that a club lead would be better for
the defenders, so I don’t want to bar a heart
lead.”

JOHN CARRUTHERS: “‘c. Interesting twist.
Partner should have a heart stopper, as I
did not promise one. Still, I'll look pretty
foolish if a heart is the only lead to beat it.
It won’t be for the first, or the last, time.
(And just because I told you guys I’m
pretty thick-skinned does not give you free
rein to flay me!)”’

We'll save our flayings for your co-
medic answers. Speaking of comedy,

STEVE WEINSTEIN: “‘c. Seems like part-
ner wants a heart lead, I think I want a
heart lead, East wants a heart lead—so let’s
make West lead a heart.”’

Any way you Say it, (c) makes sense.
But not to:

Mary & MAx Harpy: “‘d. Why should
we want a heart lead?’

Because we have queen-third.

PHILLIP ALDER: ““d. Despite Goldwater’s
tule, I see this as a toss-up between c and
d. I lean slightly toward the latter. I might
even get a diamond lead. And, as East
might have one entry, I would prefer that to
be the first heart attack.”

JOHN LOWENTHAL: “‘d. Normally, I
choose the ‘penalty card’ option when the
situation is not clear, but here I think there
is a real chance that West will try a dia-
mond if I bar the heart lead.”

cessful. After some thought Zia did
shift, but to a spade—he was playing
his partner for ace-fourth of spades.
The swing to France was small, as East-
West went down one in two spades in
the other room.

Are there bridge problems that are
peculiar to Vu-Graph watching? Abso-
lutely. If you want to test yourself,
while you are checking out the routine
French contract of three clubs, try to
figure out how South might have made
eleven tricks at hearts.

Three clubs was clearly cold, so we
had time to try to figure out the unlikely
looking result from the closed room—
two hearts, making five! This seems
impossible, as declarer has three trump
losers in addition to other problems.
However, observe what can happen on
a spade lead. Declarer wins the finesse,
and cashes all his top tricks, ruffing two
spades in the closed hand and a dia-
mond in dummy. At trick ten, declarer
leads another diamond. West, who has
followed suit throughout, ruffs, and
dummy overruffs with the ten. When a
club is led from dummy, West can do

no better than overruff with the nine
and then lead away from his ace of
hearts. Magic! My audience-mate,
Joanna Stansby, pointed out that West
could have avoided the endplay and
gained a trick through the odd play of
ruffing the last diamond with his ace of
hearts.

Think along with Zia on Board 4.
With both sides vulnerable, there are
two passes to you. What call would you
make with,

&83 959875 OC AQI42 & J?

Zia earned a nice swing by opening a
weak two diamonds. This directed
what would have been the killing lead
against three notrump, a contract bid
and made in Closed Room after a third-
position one-heart opening. The French
tried five clubs, defeated one trick.

After both sides bid aggressively to a
thin game that made, France picked up
a big swing from the good and bad luck
attached to different leads against a
game contract.

Board 7 was not too interesting in the
match—both teams went down after
opening a strong notrump when they
could have succeeded in a four-four
spade fit—, but it was a lively one in
our discussion group. Joanna and I con-
stantly debate the merits weak notrump
vs. strong notrump. She clearly won
this round. The deal also showed the
different ways that random events can
influence the results. Zia and Rosen-
berg use weak notrumps nonvulnerable,
strong notrumps vulnerable. Unfortu-
nately for the U. S., they were vulner-
able here.

One of the problems with opening a

═══════════════ PAGE 8 ═══════════════

bids three of a minor I will know what to
do.”’

Does everyone know if partner’s
three-of-a-major rebid is forcing over
two notrump? Some play that three-of-
a-major shows a weak five-five (three-
heart bid) or a weak six-four (three-
spade bid). Holding a game force,
opener transfers with an artificial three
clubs and then bids three-of-a-major,
forcing.

JEFF RUBENS (and PHILLIP ALDER simi-
larly): ““Two notrump. I reject two spades.
Among the other choices, all seriously
flawed, two notrump has the best recovery
chances should I be naming the wrong
strain.”’

MICHAEL ROSENBERG (and JOHN CAR-
RUTHERS similarly: ““Two notrump. If part-
ner bids three of a major, raise to four. If
partner bids three clubs, bid three notrump.
If partner bids three diamonds, bid five
clubs (super-cue). Finally, if partner bids
three notrump (presumably 5=4=2=2), bid
four diamonds, offering a choice between
the majors and showing diamond values
(obviously with three low clubs, else I
would pass three notrump).”’

And now, the shudders.

HENRY BETHE: ““T'wo spades. If partner
can bid again, I can show the hearts and get
to game or even, over three diamonds,
reach slam. The problem with three hearts
is that it is too committal as to strain, and
I’m not at all sure.”

Reaching slam after that start would
be a first.

BILLY EISENBERG: ““Two spades. The old
mark-time bid.”’

But you’d mark the same time if the
king-queen of hearts were the three-
deuce.

AL ROTH: “‘Two spades. I must miss a

53

game once in a while, but I don’t mind
missing a non-vul. game. However, partner
may bid again—and if so, I will get to
game.”

Sounds as if he forgot the usual, “if I
just get by this round.”’

ERIC RODWELL: ““T'wo spades. Very
close between two spades and _ two
notrump. Three notrump is good opposite,
&AKQ10xx QVAIxx Ox &#KIJx,
but not opposite,

A®AAKxxx QJAJxx Oxx #&Qx,

or less. Two spades gives partner another
chance, and we are not vulnerable.”’

Now that’s interesting. Rodwell con-
siders trying for game opposite one of
his openings, while Roth, Mr. Strong
One-Bid himself, is happy to bid only
two spades.

Cup MARTEL: ““Two spades. While you
have a lot of high cards, you aren’t likely
to make a game. Give partner,
AAKxxx QJAJxx OJx &Kx,
and no game is very good.”’
~ MarK BARTUSEK: ““Two spades. I’Il be
conservative, as only a non-vul. game is at
stake. I don’t particularly like three hearts
or three spades, but two notrump is worth
considering because partner might pattern
out on the way to game.”’

He can pattern out over two spades
just as easily.

MARSHALL MILEs: ‘““Two spades. Part-
ner’s most likely distribution is 5=4=1=3,
in which case my hand isn’t worth much.
But I’ve got to keep the bidding open, just
in case partner has a decent hand.”’

Only one panelist didn’t want to keep
the bidding open.
JOHN LOWENTHAL: “‘Pass. Take a plus,

let them try to guess out this nightmare at
the other table.”

After a trump lead, declarer, Chemla,
drew another round of trumps and tried
ace and king of clubs, which seems like
a reasonable line. I was wondering if it
might not be better immediately to play
the ace and king of hearts, continuing
with a heart ruff high if an honor fell on
the second round. If both heart honors
come down, the contract will then be
cold regardless of the black-suit splits.
However, this approach loses on some
four-one club splits when the actual
line of play would have succeeded,
such as when a defender holds two

swer depends on how often it will occur
to the defenders to dump a heart honor
on the second round of hearts and thus

deflect declarer to a losing line of play.

Another possible improvement for
South is to cash a high club at trick two.
Then, if the club queen drops, heart ace,
heart ruff high, diamond ace, heart ruff
high, spade nine to dummy, draw
trumps, club jack, diamond king, club
king. On the lie of the cards, all plays
were booked for success, so the result

He has ushered us into F3 by an-
nouncing that if you voted “Yes’”’ to F2,
then you should continue on the same

has that 3=3=2=5 strong hand, we’re
best off passing. Since it’s a guess, why
not follow the well-known bridge ad-
ages?

Kit Woo.sey (and Eric RODWELL simi-
larly): ‘‘F3. Pass. When in doubt, let the
opponents play at the five level. We have
no assurance of a good fit, and, when we
have a good fit, no guarantee that we will
find it.”

Or maybe even real-life clichés?

SAMI KEHELA: “‘F3. Pass. Half a loaf is
better than no bread.”

How about this old catchphrase:

Cup MARTEL: ‘‘F3. Pass. I would pass
and ‘stay fixed.’ ”’

We have the optimistic passers . . .

CARL HUDECEK: ‘‘F3. I pass and collect
my 800-plus.”’
... the practical ones...

JOHN CARRUTHERS: “‘F3. Pass. If we can
make anything, we'll get 300 to 500; if we
can’t, any plus will be good. And my ace
says they can’t make.”’

... and the mathematical ones...

51

JOHN LOWENTHAL: “‘F3. Pass. An impos-
sible guess, since trick total could be any-
where from 18 to 20, or even outside that
range. I live by the principle that the low
totals are more common than the high
ones, so I pay out the occasional 14 imps
and try to make it up with a string of “win
fives.’ ””

Sounds like the Lottery.

Some of the passers (see Caravelli,
on F2) complained that, had they dou-
bled in F1, the pass at this point would
have been routine. If you don’t pass the
double, you must choose a major, or,
gulp, drive to slam. First, something we
can stomach, the five-heart vs. five-
spade argument:

HENRY BETHE: “‘F3. Five spades. Gener-
ally, the weaker trump suit is better since it
makes it harder for the opponents to take
ruffs.”’

IRA RuBIN: ‘‘F3. Five hearts. Picking the
stronger color.”’

RON GERARD: “‘F3. Five hearts. Any bid
shows values. Opposite a prototype, play-
ing in hearts lets you see some more cards
before facing the spade position.”’

ERIC KOKISH: “‘F3. Five spades. To pre-
vent the impending spade ruffs against five
hearts. Of course, it could be right to play
in hearts to prevent a club ruff against five
spades.”

The only comment from the cosmo-
nauts—we have some new Russian
subscribers; their launch into slam is
likely to keep their partners from ever
opening the bidding and competing
again—came from:

PHILLip ALDER: “‘F3. Six diamonds. If I
thought partner could be 3=3=2=5 (instead
of 4=4=0=5 or 4=4=1=4), I would pass.
And, of course, that could easily be the
winning action anyway—as could bidding
five spades (or five hearts). But if I am

with a heart honor, taking another
spade finesse, and leading dummy’s
last diamond. Then, if North ruffed
with the king of hearts and returned a
trump, the eight of hearts would be the
necessary entry to the ace of spades,
-declarer’s tenth trick. Eventually, Zia
did play a diamond and we thought he
would make the contract, but he went
wrong and ruffed Jow. Now, he could
not successfully follow the line of play
described above, because North could
ruff high and kill dummy with a trump

return. Instead, Zia ruffed a club and
led the last diamond. Had Perron made
the mistake of ruffing low, Zia could
have overruffed, led a spade to dummy,
and scored his last trump en passant.
However, Perron correctly discarded
his last spade on the diamond, and Zia
was down one. A fascinating deal. The
U.S. was lucky to split the board. In the
Closed Room, the French judged badly
and arrived at three spades, which was
set one trick.

Fifty Years Ago

Many of the top players of
fifty years ago had a great flair for card
play. Often, they seemed to conjure up
a brilliant line of play or defense with
little or no calculation, as though
through intuition or inspiration. No one
exemplified the instinctive player more,
in quality or quantity of superior plays,
than Harry Fishbein. This Fishbein ex-
ploit, from the team-of-four event at the
1947 Winter Nationals, was reported in
the Jaunary, 1948, issue of The Bridge
World.

Four hearts was a popular contract
around the room. The defense attacked
spades, and most Souths discarded dia-
monds on the second and third rounds
of the suit, keeping control—except
that hearts broke five-one so the con-
tract was defeated.

Fishbein was the only South to make
four hearts. He ruffed the second spade,
cashed two clubs, and crossruffed for
ten tricks. Notice that discarding at
tricks two and three relies on better
than five-one breaks in two suits, hearts
and clubs, while the winning line re-
quires only one decent break, in clubs.
Still, we doubt that Fishy calculated the
exact odds.

I choose double rather than one notrump so

But one notrump looked quite palat-

ERIC RODWELL: “‘One notrump. Not pass

vestigate hearts if he has enough to bid.
This is more descriptive (and safer) than
double followed by two notrump over two
clubs.”

RON GERARD: “One notrump. Even if

North passes one notrump with,

it’s only a part-score swing. If he takes out
to two clubs, he should have more play
than if he bids two clubs in response to a

Kit WooLsEy: “One notrump. Doesn’t
this show a balanced hand too strong for an
opening notrump bid? Exactly what I have.
(Well, almost exactly.)”’

MARSHALL MILEs: “One notrump. I
think game is very unlikely, but the oppo-
nents might make one spade.”

Quite a thorough job by the panel.
The arguments for all the actions make

sense, and we suspect that this is one of
those problems with no theoretically
right (or wrong) answer.

EDDIE KANTAR: “One notrump. Must

This had an unexpected effect. Zia
could read it as a short-suit or weak-suit

misguessed the diamonds. The French

ner bids a slow five diamonds (over our
various actions), are we allowed to con-
tinue to six diamonds? Of course, we’d
tell the committee that we were always
driving to six, but had to investigate
seven.

Supporting that this hand is worth a
slam drive is,

MAHMOOD ZIA: “‘a. Three hearts, then
six diamonds. But if five clubs over three
notrump were exclusion, I would bid it.”’

On the other hand,

Bossy WOLFF: “‘a. Three hearts, then
four hearts. This hand is easily worth an-
other slam try.”

He’s only trying for, not driving to,
slam.

IRA Ruin: “a. Three hearts, then five
diamonds. However, if five clubs is logi-
cally a club void with big diamonds (as a
fine partnership should agree it is, by a
passed hand) then change my vote.”’

He’s also not driving to slam, and we
feel that he’d lose in committee if he
bid five clubs and then acted over a
slow five diamonds. As to changing his
vote, we can’t. Yes, five clubs probably
would show the hand he suggests, but
it’s not part of BWS.

MICHAEL ROSENBERG: “‘a. Three hearts,
then five clubs. Partner should recognize
this as a splinter [See Zia, above! —D.B. &
L.C.]. Of course, it was very lucky that
partner bid three notrump.”’

JOHN CARRUTHERS: ‘‘a. Three hearts,
then four hearts. My first duty is to tell
partner I’ve a good hand for diamonds;
thus three hearts. Then, four hearts con-
veys the ‘still interested in slam, partner,’
message. Am I a dreamer?”

No sir; dreams don’t score 100 points
in the MSC.

47

GERALD CARAVELLI: “‘a. Three hearts,
then four hearts. If partner can manage four
spades over four hearts, I’Il chance six dia-
monds; otherwise, I won’t bypass five dia-
monds.”’

Surely you’re worth a five-club cue-
bid if partner bids four spades. Picture,

@®AAx YKx OAKXxxx &#Qxx.

PHILLIP ALDER: “‘a. Three hearts, then
four diamonds. Even though I ‘know’ part-
ner’s reaction to three spades, at the table
I’m sure I would start with three hearts.
Then, over three notrump, it seems natural
to mention my diamond support and await
partner’s next move.”

We always like honest problem D
voters. Yes, if we had a wire that part-
ner’s next call would be a space-saving
three notrump, we too might opt for
three spades.

STEVE WEINSTEIN: “‘a. Three hearts, then
four diamonds. If I get by the next round,
this round should be okay.”

Please leave the Rothisms to Roth.
There was no comment from Kantar,
but he scored 50 points (a, four clubs)

on a part-score deal. In the Closed

Again there was good news from the
Closed Room. The auction there started
the same, but where Zia’s three-club
bid had been constructive (he could
have bid two notrump with a weak hand
and long clubs), his counterpart’s three
clubs had been ambiguous. Because of
that, the other East bid more aggres-
sively after West’s second double, and
the final contract was six clubs. On the
bidding, South figured to have six
spades, so the French declarer chose to
play North for the queen of clubs. This
gave the U. S. a favorable swing that
could have been just as large a loss.

fense. Maybe taking away a round of bid-
ding will cause the opponents to get to the
wrong major.”’

It’s nice to take away one whole
round of the bidding. As you may sur-
mise, our hearts (and diamonds) are
with:

Kir Woo sey: “Five diamonds. Bid the
limit of the hand before East gets a chance
to show his distribution. Anything less is
clearly an insufficient call.”

MARK BARTUSEK: “Five diamonds. At
this vulnerability, let’s make them guess. It
might play better in clubs, but I feel safer
in my seven-bagger, and I want to put
maximum pressure on the opponents.”’

STEVE WEINSTEIN: “Five diamonds. The
bid they least want to hear.”

We never like to pass up the opportu-
nity to let our panelists show off their
latest pets.

Mary & Max Harpy’s: “Four dia-
monds. In our methods, we would bid four
clubs to transfer.”

That’s nice. Give your LHO, who
may hold five-five in the majors, an
easy four-diamond bid. Count us out of
that convention.

Boppy WOLFF: “Four diamonds. When
vulnerable opponents open a strong two-
bid, higher preemptive tactics may be
called for.”

Higher, we say!

RON GERARD: “Four diamonds. Not a
beauty contest. I can’t see North’s having
to make a save-versus-slam decision with-
out help, but I’m ready to lose the post-
mortem if the auction comes up craps. If I
win the Silver Platter Award (minus a
bunch when they’re cold for a partial), [’ll
chalk it up to the requirements of the mod-
ern game.”’

45

Bidding four was modern in the 80’s.
Lastly,

EDDIE KANTAR: “Four diamonds. Just
because I have a spade void doesn’t mean
they can make a zillion spades. Besides, I
have a little surprise.”

And we have a nice surprise for you,
another 100 points, giving you 210 for

appropriate entries; in the ACBL’s
ranking system, almost every tourna-
ment player was a “Master” of some
sort or other.

Variations notwithstanding, there are
basically two kinds of tournament re-
ports. One aims mainly at presenting
interesting or instructive deals, the
other at reporting and accounting for
the results. Although he was not the

sole inventor of any techniques, Edgar
brought new dimensions to both varie-
ties. To the “‘good deals’? type, he
added the common-theme approach
nowadays typically applied in non-rep-
ortorial articles. For an illustration, let’s
look at some snatches from the the-
matic report of his atypical triumph in
the Individual, from the March, 1957,
issue of The Bridge World.

Life Masters Individual

by Edgar Kaplan

While 1 enthusiastically
approve of the result of this year’s Mas-
ters Individual, I can’t say that I had a
very good time playing in it. And I usu-
ally do. This is a nerve-shattering tour-
nament if you’re in a good position to
win. I could never relax and really en-
joy the mad scramble. [Editor’s note
(by Moyse): It has, perhaps, been sub-
tly indicated that Mr. Kaplan was the
winner of this year’s Masters Individ-
ual, with its record-breaking field of
136, but we like to make everything
pellucidly clear: He was. | |

There are three factors in the winning
of this event: you must play reasonably
well; you need a lot of fortitude; and
you must be enormously lucky. Luck is
the theme of this article, as it should be
in one about the Individual.

There are many kinds of good luck in
bridge, and I had all of them. In this
first hand I was lucky enough to have
my partner make an excellent play. (In
this event, in which even the best play-
ers produce their worst bridge, this is
the very height of luck.)

I was South, playing with Geoffrion,
of Montreal. ...

... a well-deserved top for my part-
ner, a lucky top for me.

Another Canadian, Eric Murray, of
Toronto, also earned an excellent score
for me with accurate play, but he was
my opponent....

. . . This last hand was the luckiest of
all. It came up in the final session, and
the tournament hinged on the outcome.

That seems to say he is prepared to
defend five diamonds if LHO bids it.
But not,

CARL HUDECEK: “‘Four hearts. And, un-
less pard doubles, I’m bidding five hearts
over five diamonds.”

Kit Woo sey: “‘Four hearts. Let the op-
ponents make the first wrong guess. We
know we will want to compete to at least
four hearts anyway, so why not bid it
now?”

STEVE WEINSTEIN: “Four hearts. I may
miss a slam—but four diamonds gets us
there too often, and two notrump is invita-
tional to three diamonds for the oppo-
nents.”

Bossy WOLFF: “Four hearts. Preemp-
tive value is quite often worth more than
science.”

Normally, we love to sign off with
Bobby, ever the voice of reason.

However, we need to go to the co-
author of the previously mentioned
book.

AL RoTH: “‘Two clubs. I know the bid-
ding will continue, and I hope I will learn
what is best later.”’

And one panelist who is exhibiting
increased paranoiac symptoms,

EDDIE KANTAR: “‘Redouble. I don’t

know how many points I'll get for this
one.”

Don’t you know that you need 10
HCP to redouble? Not to worry: We’ll
give you 10 here, making your two-
problem total 110.

A continuation of the last problem’s
exercise in obstructionism. Our vulner-
able opponent has opened two clubs. In
the modern style we think that,

is plenty good enough. Of course, you
could be playing against Ira Rubin, who
might not open two clubs even with
another ace. (We hear that he can’t re-
member the last time he opened two
clubs on a distributional hand.)

The four-diamond bidders believe
they are doing their all. The three-dia-
mond bidders must live under a black
cloud to be so pessimistic, and we can’t
say what we think of the two-diamond
bidders, at least not until we give them
a chance first.

JOHN CARRUTHERS: “Two diamonds.
This looks kind of wimpish, but no jump is
suitable with such a good hand. Why
would I want to go high when it’s possible
they can’t make anything? And neither
three nor four gets the message across. Just

have extra length.”

We believe that last sentence con-
tained a triple-negative (we play only
double-negatives).

taking a wrong turn in the hotel lobby.
In contrast, Edgar assumed that the
reader began with an appropriate re-
spect for the world’s top players and
moved on from there. If he thought
someone had messed up he said so, and
explained why. This novel approach
brought tournament descriptions up
from the old boy network to the level of
at least semi-responsible reporting;
once Edgar had done it, others did also.
The upheaval in bridge journalism be-
gan less than two years after ““New Sci-
ence”’’ had begun to revolutionize table
behavior. It was less dramatic, but its

In his first big-time tournament re-
port, arguably the best ever, Edgar used
a box-score approach, daring to record
his view of the exact effectiveness of
each of the participants in the match
between Italy and the United States that
decided the 1958 Bermuda Bowl. Every
educated person should be familiar with
the entire document, which extended
over five issues of The Bridge World
(beginning in September, 1958), but
here you'll have to settle for an abridge-
ment that tries to preserve the flavor of
the original. (The imps in this match are

The 1958 World Championship

I have just finished an ex-
haustive analysis of all 164 hands of the
1958 World Championship match,
United States vs. Italy, at Lake Como.

Mainly, my objective has been to as-
sign “‘charges.”” How many interna-
tional match-points did each player cost
his team? Who were most effective and
least effective for each side?

Before presenting conclusions, let
me outline my method of charging.

notrump is down two. But Stone led the
spade nine! Roth took his king and
shifted to a low club, and even now
Siniscalco had only eight tricks, but on
the run of spades both Stone and Roth
discarded enough clubs to let declarer
get his ninth trick in diamonds.

man Kay.

Bossy WOLFF: “‘One heart. Why panic?
Bid what is in front of your nose.”’

MICHAEL ROSENBERG: “‘One heart.
Should bid my best suit. Two hearts or
three hearts, while perhaps making things
harder for them, is too likely to mislead
partner. This rates to be our deal.”

MAHMOOD ZIA: “One heart. What brilli-
ancy can the imaginative come up with on
this nothing problem?”’ |

If he has nothing clever to say, who
could?

GERALD CARAVELLI: ““One heart. I’d like
to know more about the opponents’ nega-
tive-double style. Could East be three-three
in the majors? Nevertheless, I can’t see any
reason not to start bidding my suits.”

We’re sure you readers want to hear
from the people who prevented the first
unanimous vote since creation.

DICK FREEMAN: “One spade. Seems the
best way to start in order to get all my bids
in.”

We don’t like to argue with a man
who wins virtually every event he en-
ters, but give your partner doubleton-

jack of both majors, or any equal-length |

holding, and you will see the folly of
introducing your spades first.

MARSHALL MILEs: ““Two clubs. I have
no strong feelings about this. In view of
my holding, it’s unlikely the opponents
will play in a major suit, but perhaps my
bid will encourage partner to compete to
three diamonds over three clubs.”

Wait a second. Eleven major-suit
cards and no clubs and it’s only un-
likely they won’t play in a major? And
you want to encourage partner to com-
pete in what?

Your ex-partner hasn’t been happy

with his MSC scores lately, so here’s
good news for Eddie. |

get a few points for this.”

A classic bridge book is titled,
Bridge is a Partnership Game. This
problem is a test for our panelists on
that concept. Are they willing to get
their partners involved (by making a
bid other than four hearts), or will they
bid four hearts and hope to land on their
feet?

If we convince ourselves to consult
with partner, what is the best method?

PAUL TRENT: ““Two clubs. Set the de-
fense first, the offense later.”’

MICHAEL ROSENBERG: ““Two clubs. If I
ever get to bid again, partner will know this
was a lead-director. Nothing wrong with
the simple four-heart bid, especially if
you're a good guesser.”’

ledger, I put those five IMP in a special
column for adverse swings caused, not
by error, but by bad luck or by hands
especially suited to the opponents’ bid-
ding style. I kept two of these “Act of
God” columns, one for each team, and
with all the results in, comparison
would show if one team was substan-
tially luckier than the other.

The final tabulation shows _ three
types of notations in each player’s col-
umn: charges for errors, credits for bril-
liance, and black marks for uncharged
errors. The net figure is the player’s
total IMP charges, less IMP credits,
plus (for I am a purist) a one-point
charge for each black mark. This net
figure, divided by the number of boards
played, gives a fraction—actually, the
number of IMP lost per board played—
which, in my opinion, is a reliable in-
dex of general effectiveness.

Since this article will take the form of
analysis of each player’s performance,
it will, inevitably, deal more with per-
sonalities than is the custom in bridge
reports. I make no apology for this. My
team has not done well enough to give
us a chance to play for the U.S. next
year; I am not in a glass house, and so I
can afford to throw stones. But it is
only fair to emphasize the obvious: op-
portunities for brilliance are few; for
error, countless. In addition to the few
brilliancies and many errors reported
here, each player made thousands of
sound, accurate decisions which go un-
heralded because the right play or bid is
unspectacular.

The Italians

I was, I admit, very much surprised
by my final tabulation on the Italian

players:
Charges Boards CperB

Belladonna 13 92 141
Avarelli 17 92 .185
Forquet Zi 144 187
Chiaradia 23 92 250
Siniscalco = 37 144 257
D’Alelio. 35 92 381

I had always thought of Avarelli and
Belladonna as the third-string Italian
pair, and apparently the Italians agreed.
In New York last year they played less
than any of the others, and in Como
they shared second billing with Chiara-
dia and D’Alelio. But they were clearly
the best pair around this year.

My estimate is that fairly good play
will lose one IMP every four boards.
Par, then, is .250 (and it is not common
to play well under the pressure of the
World Championship match). So the
record of Belladonna and Avarelli as a
pair is truly remarkable.

There were very few charges against
them. ... Their system cost Belladonna
and Avarelli a small loss on Deal 94
when they reached the wrong partial,
but almost all of their infrequent bid-
ding troubles seemed to arise after take-
out doubles. . . . a fourth occurred on

Double Pass Pass Pass

Forquet opened a high club and
shifted to his singleton diamond. Stone
won in dummy and led the heart ten,
which was allowed to hold. Now he
played a club from dummy, and Sinis-
calco did not rise with his queen or
duck—he played the club fen. When
this held he gave Forquet a diamond
ruff, was put back in by the marked
underlead in clubs to his queen, and
gave Forquet another ruff to set the
contract. Nicely done.

Of course Stone had made the de-
fense easier than was necessary. Instead
of playing a club from dummy he
should ruff a spade and play the heart
king. To beat the contract now Forquet
must lead the club jack to be overtaken
by the queen, and after ruffing a dia-
mond must underlead again on the mere
chance of finding West with the club
ten.

It was ungenerous of Stone not to

give Forquet the opportunity for such
brilliance.

I can start my discussion of Chiaradia
and D’Alelio with this same hand, No.
14, for at the other table the auction
went:

EAST SouTH WeEsT NORTH
Crawford D’Alelio Becker Chiaradia
19 14 Double 29
Double 390 Double (All Pass)

Becker led a trump, and D’Alelio
was lucky to make five trump tricks,
one spade ruff in dummy and one other
trick, for down 300, a loss of three IMP.

In my view, the three diamond bid is
a clear violation of partnership. North
has heard the opening heart bid by East,
and he knows that his run-out to two
hearts shuts out possible contracts of
two clubs or two diamonds; he ‘could
bid one notrump if he so _ chose.
D’Alelio should pass two hearts dou-
bled even with a void, and so his single-
ton ten is a bonanza.

The Americans
My final tabulation of the perform-
ance of the individual Americans con-

firmed my preconceptions in some re-
spects but startled me in others.

For the Incumbents, two notrump
was a game-forcing raise. Three dia-
monds showed a minimum, so Nilsland
terminated any further investigation.

The Swedes said afterwards that
either West shouldn’t open a non-open-
ing bid or East shouldn’t force to game.
That’s true, but many pairs would be in
game at IMPs. Switch West’s hearts
and clubs and four spades is acceptable.

The Newcomers did well when Lars,
West, despite his fitting king of dia-
monds, opted not to move over two
spades. This ostensibly remarkable de-
cision was based on real-world tactical
considerations. With a fit, the Danes
prefer not to pass out a passed-hand
one-level response, fearing this would
make entry into the auction too easy for
the opponents. Thus, there was only the
mildest of inferences that East did not
have a rock-bottom minimum hand.
(This is not to say that Lars’ decision
was right. It seems mighty conservative
to me anyway.)

After the catchall diamond and a

Fallenius’ one-spade rebid strongly
suggested only three trumps in a weak-
notrump hand. With four spades, he
would have an unbalanced hand and
would have jumped to two spades. Un-
willing to assume they had nine running
tricks, Nilsland made a directional ask-
ing-bid with three hearts. When Fal-
lenius couldn’t bid three notrump, Nil-
sland was endplayed into four spades.

For the young Danes, Lars, West, be-
gan with a weak notrump. In North
America, East would presumably have
bid two notrump followed by three
hearts, the lebensohl route with four
spades. and a heart stopper. Here,
though, Morten made a negative dou-
ble, then offered a choice of games,
while promising a heart stopper.

Seemingly, East-West are inextrica-
bly trapped into a diamond contract by
North’s diabolical one diamond open-
ing. The Americans cleverly played
with West as declarer and didn’t get a
diamond lead away from the ace-jack
fifth, while the Italians foolishly played
the hand from the East position, and
South’s trump lead beat them an extra
trick.

*

... Incidentally, weak two-bids were
almost a total loss for the Americans
throughout this (as throughout every
other World Championship) match.
Only one of them gained, and the net
average was two IMP lost for each
weak two-bid used.

Becker Forquet Crawford Siniscalco
29 4h 59 Double
Pass Pass Pass

Forquet cashed two top spades and

then led the ten of spades for partner to
trump. Siniscalco did not give Forquet
the club ruff he was angling for, but
Becker had to lose a club anyway, for
down 300. Since four spades was dou-
bled and set 200 at the other table, the
U. S. lost 500 points—six IMP.

Now, I don’t admire Becker’s two-
heart opening, but I have charged the
whole loss to Crawford. The vagueness
of the requirements for a weak two-bid
and the liberties taken within even these
hazy limits cause many a loss. But why
here? It seems to me that Crawford
should expect to beat four spades, per-
haps a lot; and just as clearly he should
expect five hearts to go down, no mat-
ter what sort of two-heart bid partner
has. A decision like that five-heart bid
can be justified only by success, and
this one wasn’t so justified.

*

In general, Crawford’s performance,
especially in the first half of the match,
was astonishing. Some of his errors
were of the sort you just don’t expect
from one of the world’s greatest play-
ers.... And on Deal 64, non-vulnerable
against vulnerable, he held:

&K6VQ42 0K76432 &J7.

One club (artificial, strong) was
opened at his left; pass from partner;
two clubs (artificial, strong) at his right.
‘“‘Three diamonds,”’ bid Crawford, un-
daunted by the minimum of 17 points at
his left, and an ace and a king or three
kings at his right. Down 1300. It’s hard
to believe.

However, most of Crawford’s
charges are far more reasonable, .. . I
have more sympathy for Crawford and

Fallenius, West, began with a nebu-
lous diamond. His two-club rebid guar-
anteed at least five clubs. Then, over
Nilsland’s relay, opener showed spade
help. However, East felt that this denied
a heart holding as good as ace-king, so
he didn’t think seven was feasible.
(Still, if West’s red-suit king is in dia-
monds, seven clubs is a highly desir-
able contract.)

When the Newcomers have agreed a
minor, they telescope the responses to
Roman Key-Card Blackwood. So, five
diamonds announced two key cards
without the queen of clubs; six hearts
showed that king, simultaneously deny-
ing the king of diamonds. The queen of
spades, rather than the queen of dia-
monds, was a lucky bonus.

have West use RKCB. (But how?)

Fallenius’ two-heart opening showed
four hearts and a longer minor with 10-
13 points. In response to two relays, he
described a maximum with clubs and
only four-five in the two suits. Four
diamonds was natural, five clubs a cue-
bid that denied any major-suit controls.

The Newcomers have an interesting
agreement. One spade was fourth-suit
forcing, but a jump to two spades in-
stead would have been a game-force
with four hearts. So, when Morten
jumped to three hearts, he was known
to have only three. Via two doses of
RKCB, Morten learned that his brother
had one key card and the queen of
hearts but no side king.

from the current American style. And,
of course, this great difference causes
similar discrepancies at the upper end
of the scale as well.

British experts have much more ex-
perience than their American counter-
parts in defending against varieties of
the Multi, a two-diamond opening to

show a weak two-bid in an unspecified
major or, perhaps, a very strong hand of
one sort or another. We are always in-
terested in their views on how best to
cope with the beast. Author Sowter has
some ideas here that are worthy of dis-
cussion; we would render a verdict of
“unproven” to his final product. |

Challenge the Champs

conducted by Phillip Alder

Challenge the Champs is a continuing bidding battle. Each month, two lead-
ing pairs compete, the Incumbents (they bid last month too) and the Newcomers
(who will be back next month) bidding deals from actual play (taken from old
tournament reports or submitted by readers). Awards assigned to final con-
tracts are estimates of the matchpoint expectancy on a 12 top in a strong pairs
contest. Awards are rounded off to the nearest full matchpoint. An award
embraces all lower equivalent contracts in the same strain.

The deals for next month’s match are elsewhere in this issue.

FALLENIUS-NILSLAND vs. LARS & MORTEN LUND MADSEN

This month we have a Scandi-
navian battle. The Incumbents, trying
for their fourth victory toward a place
in the Challenge of the Decade, are
Bjorn Fallenius and Mats Nilsland from
Sweden. Well, Fallenius is Swedish by
birth, but now he lives primarily in
New York City. They use a strong-club
system with five-card majors, 14-16
notrump and a nebulous one diamond.
When holding at least game-going val-
ues, they usually ascend into a relay
auction.

The Newcomers are brothers Lars
and Morten Lund Madsen. Both are
students at Copenhagen University,
Lars studying economics and Morten
mathematics. They were the mainstays
of the Danish team that won last year’s
World Junior Championship, and have

33

had several medal-winning perform-
ances in European junior events. How-
ever, Lars, at 25, is too old for further
success at that level. Morten, at 23, has
two more years of eligibility. The
Danes use an Acol-style system but
with five-card one-spade openings.
They employ a variable notrump (11-
14 nonvul., 15-17 vul.) and, most un-
usually for Europeans, weak two-bids
in three suits.

B. Jay Becker’s record at Como I
would call good, but not up to his usual
standard... .

I suppose I should give him a credit
for producing a favorable swing on
Deal 147. First hand, non-vulnerable
vs. vulnerable, he opened three clubs
on:

&— 9752 9A9N42 &QIJ10987.

Chiaradia, West, doubled; Crawford
bid four clubs, and D’Alelio jumped to
five diamonds. Becker passed, Chiara-
dia bid five hearts, Crawford passed,
and D’Alelio went on to six diamonds.
Why Mr. Becker didn’t double I'll
never know, but he passed and so did
everyone else—down five. Now, at
IMP scoring the difference between
500 and 1400 is relatively slight—only
three IMP—but that final pass outrages
me anyway. So I’ll be hanged if I’ll
hand out a credit for bidding like that.

*

No record of Becker’s performance
would be complete without Deal 6. He
held:

431098754 95106 OA2 &A.

Crawford opened one club; Becker
responded one spade. Crawford raised
to two spades, and now Becker cue-bid
three hearts! Hearts, that is. Picked up
an IMP, too, by stopping the lead.
Nowadays Mr. B. is seen playing all
sorts of modern gadgets, like Stayman,
and here he is psyching! Don’t tell me
about old dogs.

*

Silodor, on his record in Nationals
over the past few years, is very likely
the finest player in the U. S. And he

27

was the key man on the team: he had
three partners and played more boards
than any of the others. So it was disap-
pointing and costly that he was not at
the top of his usually magnificent
game.

*

...1’m not sure that Silodor should
double four spades, but I know he
shouldn’t save against it. In my view, to
push the opponents into a contract and
then sacrifice against it is one of the
gravest bidding crimes.

However, there was no actual swing
on this hand. At the other table the auc-
tion went: . . . Just as Stone was about
to pay the penalty for his rashness—the
difference between a rash bid and a
courageous one is a matter of result—
Chiaradia came to his rescue...

*

Against Italy, Roth and Stone did not
play except as partners (Roth played
briefly with Crawford, but against Ar-
gentina), so it is convenient to treat
their records jointly. They were, in gen-
eral, an effective pair, tossing away a
little more than their share of points, .
especially early in the match, but play-
ing a very active style and earning back
many points. Stone, particularly, cre-
ated many favorable swings for the
US.

On the whole the Roth-Stone System
was less successful than Roth and Stone
were as individuals. Unluckily, many of
their specialized bids and conventions
simply didn’t come up. . . . It was not
only negative doubles that were few
and far between. The cards at Como
stubbornly refused to accommodate
themselves to most of the Roth-Stone

General Conclusions

After all I have written it may come
as a surprise that I consider the Italy-
United States match to have been
played quite well. Technically, the
match was on a very high plane in-
deed—there were few errors of dummy
play or defense; of these few, not more
than three or four were really glaring.
And the bidding errors were generally

ones involving fine judgment, not gross,

overbids or underbids.

Slam bidding was the worst depart-
ment for both teams. The U.S. bid
twelve slams—five made, seven went
down. We missed four good slams that
would have made, and one good one
that wouldn’t. One of the U.S. slams
that made should have been beaten;
conversely, one of those beaten should
have been made. All in all, a miserable
showing.

The Italians were no better. They bid
only eight slams—four made, four

didn’t. That looks almost respectable,
but they-missed five good slams, and,
of the four they bid and made, two were
in the wrong contract and one should
have been beaten. One of the slams
they bid and went down on was a good
contract, but they luckily stayed out of
another good one that only failed be-
cause of stacked cards.

I came to no conclusions about the
“battle of the systems.’ Somehow,
there were very few strictly systemic
swings—either pickups or losses—for
the Neapolitan or Roman _ systems.
Roth-Stone seemed to have quite a few
systemic losses, but the results are in-
conclusive. The other Americans did
fairly well with psychics, unimpres-
sively with preempts, jump overcalls,
disastrously with weak two-bids. I saw
no signs that anyone was losing points
through unfamiliarity with the meaning
of his opponents’ bidding. The swings
were due to judgment, rarely to system
at all.

Over the long match luck was fairly
even. The Americans lost, on my reck-
oning, 51 IMP through unlucky swings.
They gained 44 IMP in lucky ones. (By
luck, I mean good contracts going
down, bad ones making; slams on fi-
nesses, guess situations on lead, etc.)
We were, then, slightly unlucky, but
not enough to make the difference.

We lost because we were outplayed;
we did a few more good things than the
Italians did, but a lot more bad things.
But don’t believe that vague impression
floating around’ (at least here in New
York) that the U.S. players performed
miserably in Como. That’s not true. I
think they played better than almost any

sponder’s cheapest rebid is a relay for
side length. Opener shows his four-card
suit, using three notrump to show
spades when hearts are agreed, or bids
four of the agreed suit to show 6-3-2-2
with weak trumps. Responder can relay
again for loser count (which should be
without adjustments so that responder
can count his cover cards). If responder
does not start with a relay, his bid
shows a splinter in a six-loser hand.] —

Book Reviews

Newspaper columnists who write for
local publications suffer under a severe
handicap: They are constrained by the
truth. How they must frequently yearn
to change a card or two, or a call or
play, to purify a deal of its real-world
flaws. This hindrance reduces the fla-
vor of some of the articles in ‘The
Times Book of Bridge’’ (Batsford;
112 pages; $13.95 paperbound), an
eclectic collection of Robert Sheehan’s
work for Zhe Times of London. Despite
this drawback and some unevenness in
level of topic sophistication and depth
of analysis, we think most avid bridge
readers, especially non-Britons, will
find the book worthwhile. Warts and
all; the deals have points of interest.

In order to make this structure easy to
learn and to remember, I have not made
it maximally efficient. Where possible,
bids mean what they sound like: three
notrump shows notrump shape, a jump
in trumps shows good trumps, rebid-
ding the agreed major shows no short-
ness, and so forth.

tion’s most successful European com-
petitors, has a good eye for what seri-
ous players will find intriguing. Several
problem situations present fresh chal-
lenges. We singled out non-Britons
above because the parts of the book we
liked best were those that revolved
around in-depth portraits of several of
the leading British bridge personalities,
both alive and dead. Some of the deals
and anecdotes in those chapters were
new to us, and the section on the late
Irving Rose sparkled brightly enough to
provide sufficient light for an entire
book.

teams. According to my calculations
our teams would have won in 1955,
1956 and 1957 if they had played as
well as the U.S. team this year. It’s just

ship performance and played better

still.

But wait till next time.

A Jacobean Proposal
by Henry Bethe, Ithaca, NY

The J acoby Two-Notrump
strong major-suit raise responded to the
need for an efficient forcing raise after
limit raises came into vogue. Develop-
ments in bidding theory since that time
suggest that the original method can
profitably be modified.

Popular competitive-bidding theory
holds that a side with a nine-card fit and
half the deck should compete to the
three level—so why not get there
quickly? Accordingly, a current trend is
the use of a direct double raise of a
major with hands weaker than limit-
raise strength. This, in turn has led to a
search for alternative mechanisms for
the limit raise. A common solution has
been to devote the entire range from
two of opener’s major to three of
Opener’s major to raises. Using so
many bids for this purpose is not pro-
ductive; my proposal, below, avoids
this waste.

A Revised Jacoby Two-Notrump

A response of two notrump to one of
a major promises a limit raise or bet-
ter—that is, seven-and-a-half or fewer

30

losers in the losing trick count or a hand
with four potentially working important
cards; the hand may include a singleton
with exactly six losers, or as few as
three trumps if responder has no single-
ton. Opener rebids as follows:

Three clubs: Six or more losers; a
minimum. In effect, this says, “I may
be passing a limit raise.”’ [If responder
rebids three diamonds, a strong relay,
opener shows his distribution using the
“‘higher-bid scheme”’ for bids of three
hearts or higher, shown below. Alterna-
tively, responder may bid three of
opener’s major to show a limit raise,
bid the other major to show six losers
and some singleton (opener can relay to
discover the short suit), or make a
higher new-suit bid to show concen-
trated values in a hand margially worth
a slam try. ]

Three diamonds: Key-card Black-
wood. [After the Blackwood asks are
complete, the partnership can employ
help-suit bids or asking bids. ]

Higher-bid scheme: Any bid above
three diamonds shows five or fewer

On the surface, Alan Mould’s
‘“‘Preempts”’ (Batsford; 143 pages;
$16.95 paperback) is designed to pre-
sent the fundamental techniques of
Opening and responding to preemp-
tives, to describe today’s widely vary-
ing styles and the tradeoffs among
them, to create awareness of the oppor-
tunities for obstructive tactics other
than openings, and to add occasional
observations and personal comments
about which choices of approach and
method seem to the author more or less
likely to be successful.

This book does all that, but... sur-
prise! The best part is a large, excel-
lently presented, theoretical section on
card values, how to judge whether your
strength is offensive or defensive, com-
parison of risks and rewards—in short,
just the sort of knowledge one needs to
advance from formula follower to intel-
ligent bidder. This discussion is simple,
easy to follow, and right on target. It is
introduced in the context of deciding
whether or not to open a three-bid, and
thus is mildly mislabeled (because it
applies much more generally), but this
part alone is worth the price of the book
to an improving player. That’s two win-
ners for Mould’s commonsense ap-
proach to advanced bidding topics; his
book on slam bidding has similar posi-
tive characteristics.

pages; $13.95 paperbound). The book
begins with and throughout emphasizes
the critical concept in the area of ana-
lyzing how to handle individual suit
holdings: distinguishing between the
abstract correct play in isolation and the
appropriate handling in the context of
trying to make a contract. This theme is
handled well, especially in the 36 quiz
deals that augment the lessons and nu-
merous individual suit discussions. The
tutorial level is elementary to low inter-
mediate, but most of the quiz deals
stretch to greater challenges. Overall,
the book is good, but we cannot give it
our highest recommendation because
the authors goof in a few places, mess-
ing up an occasional analysis while try-
ing to set up the desired theme. We
sympathize; we’ve been there our-

Tony Sowter’s ‘Step-By-Step
Competitive Bidding”’ (Batsford; 143
pages; $16.95 paperbound) is a solid
introduction to contested auctions, both
what we would call “‘competitive”’
(your side opens, the opponents act)
and ‘“‘defensive’’ (the opponents open).
Unfortunately, as we have seen before
in similar British books, the overcalling
style on opposite sides of the Atlantic is
so different that the text will be mis-
leading to American readers. The first
example hand,

is described as a “‘perfect hand for a

For the Incumbents, Nilsland, East,
doubled two hearts to show length in
the minors. Then, when his partner
could do no more than three clubs, he
was happy to pass. Protect the plus at
pairs.

Morten couldn’t double two hearts
because it would have been for penal-
ties. So, when his partner was still there
with three clubs, he had hidden assets
to show. He tried for three notrump
with his cue-bid, then subsided when
Lars repeated clubs. Much of the time,
this extra level wouldn’t be fatal.

Is it better to play East’s double of
two hearts for takeout or for penalty?
Traditionally, over the enemy length, it
is for penalties. However, the low-level
penalty double is on the World Wild
Life list of endangered species; some
experts use this one for takeout.

The Incumbents bid like Americans
of yesteryear: A strong notrump fol-
lowed by Stayman and an invitational
two spades. Then, two notrump showed
a maximum with only two spades.
Three clubs was nonforcing, but
opener, with good clubs and controls,
had enough to raise. A fine sequence.

Being nonvulnerable, Morten could
not open one notrump. (When polling
pairs using variable ranges, one is
tempted out of curiosity to ask for cer-
tain deals to be bid twice, once with
each range.) Many Acol players would
start with one heart, but the Danes sen-
sibly bid four-card suits up the line op-
posite an unpassed partner. Over the
strong-notrump rebid, Lars jumped to
three clubs to describe his invitational
five-five in the blacks. Morten was al-
ways bidding game from that point, but
he dabbled with three hearts en route.

jump responses at all; their two-club
balancing device never came up (in
fact, believe it or not, they had only one
balancing auction of any sort); they had
only one weak two-bid, one psychic, no
psychic controls, only one strong single
raise of a major, and even the forcing
response of one notrump to a major suit

Dealer [South] passed, and Stone,
second-hand, passed also! Third hand
opened one diamond, and Roth jumped
to two spades. Everyone passed, so
Roth had bought himself a contract. He
made it with an overtrick too, because
the spades split; but of course the Ital-
ians bid four hearts at the other table
and made it easily. Who was responsi-
ble for the four IMP loss?

Roth’s jump overcall is certainly
atypical, but I don’t think it is unrea-
sonable on this vulnerability, facing a
passed hand. Obviously, he must have
felt that the hand belonged to the en-
emy and that it was worth a little risk to
disrupt their communications. Probably
the danger of his missing four hearts
never occurred to him. Personally, I
consider Stone to be the guilty party.
Granted that he believes in “‘sound”’
opening bids; surely he could “‘take his

The BRIDGE WORLD

life in his hands” and open this holding.

*

The concept of supersound openings
was costly to Roth and Stone on other
hands . . . [They] paid for their solid
openings in a different way when they
overbid to doubtful games on Deals 33
and 106. In both cases a passed hand
jumped to two notrump over a third-
hand opening, and both times the origi-
nal passes were normal, with 11 and
12-point hands. But in each case opener
carried on to three notrump with a
skinny minimum opening, clearly hop-

ing for a strictly ““Roth-Stone’’ passed

28

hand of 13 points or better. The result?
Down one; down one. Six IMP lost.

Do you suppose that opener went on
in these instances because he hadn’t
opened a very light “‘third-hand’’ bid?
But Roth and Stone weren’t opening
light hands in third or fourth seat. Stone
passed, third-hand:

The Italians opened one notrump and
arrived briskly at three notrump, mak-
ing five. Four spades was down two. A
rather silly result, but neither American
did anything terrible. Crawford’s hand
is top-heavy for a one notrump opening
(Avarelli-Belladonna play theirs as 17-
20 points). I would respond one heart
with Becker’s hand, but one spade is
surely reasonable. Crawford’s rebid is a
problem—perhaps a two-spade under-
bid or a three-spade overbid would be
better, but two clubs looks all right.
And by now the Americans were on the
hook, for no one wanted to bid notrump
without a heart stopper. Oh, Becker
might bid two diamonds, not three
clubs; Crawford might bid three, not
four, spades. But I’m not sure it would
help. A bad hand for Old Science.

On Deal 29 this pair, having a sort of
heart stopper this time, decided to play
notrump. [See top of next column. |

Forquet led the five of hearts, Sinis-
calco won with his king and returned a
low heart. Becker had to guess whether
to put in his nine or his queen, and he
went wrong—he chose the queen, and
the Italians cashed five heart tricks, for
down one.

Actually, I think Becker’s play is
correct. If the hearts are 4-4, or if East
has five, Becker’s play makes relatively

little difference; only if the lead was
from three is it crucial. And a lead from
three to a jack seems a little more at-
tractive than from three to an ace. [In
contrast, if you assume a heart would
always be led, it is twice as likely that
the opening leader’s honor is not the
jack than that it is.—J/.R. ]

The Italians also played three
notrump, but South, with two little
hearts, was declarer. With a small heart
lead, declarer has no option—he must
put in the nine. So Italy picked up a
lucky nine IMP by playing from the
“wrong” side.

But it wasn’t all luck; five diamonds
is on ice, and at IMP scoring there is
little excuse for being in notrump.
Surely Crawford should have contrived
to show his diamond fit.

Fallenius knew more. The two-heart

Morten’s rebid showed a slam-try

This deal was excellent for the In-

one heart eight-plus points, no five-card
major, no good five-card minor; one
spade some five-card or longer major.
Then Fallenius, West, used three relays
to learn that Nilsland had 1=5=3=4

four diamonds was a cue-bid, four

flawlessly throughout the long match—
but Rapée, here as ever, produced his
best when it counted most.

Let me start his short crime list with
his much-criticized action on Deal 60.
He held:

AQ V— $976542 &QI987S5:

he opened with three clubs. This re-
sulted, it may be recalled, in a five club
sacrifice, down 700, when five dia-
monds might well have been made.

I charged Rapée with a substantial
loss, but I have sympathy for his bid.
The alternative is to pass (planning on
backing in later with an unusual
notrump overcall), and it seems to me
that, first-hand in this vulnerability situ-
ation, the terribly weak freak holding
calls for some sort of drastic preemp-
tive action.

Rapée played a very active style in
Como; he was always on the move, try-
ing to create favorable swings; yet this
was the only one of his “‘operations”’
that ended in American disaster. He
psyched repeatedly and was never pun-
ished. On Deal 130 he jostled the Ital-
lans into a six-spade contract that
needed a 3-3 trump split—they got it—
while the Americans played in a cold
six-diamond spot after an unimpeded
auction; and on Deals 108 and 140, pre-
viously discussed, his psychics gained
heavily. Moreover, the unsettling effect
on opponents should not be discounted.

I charged Rapée for the rather ludi-
crous result on Deal 139:

Surely, if two clubs had not been

spades, with the expectation of making
it. (Actually, an overtrick is available.)
I don’t think he should take such a dim
view of his prospects because of the
double. And, if he was afraid of a disas-
ter at spades, why not run to two hearts
first? I imagine he intended the two dia-
monds as a cue-bid for the majors, but I
think that Silodor was right to play it to
be a suit, at least until the bid got dou-
bled. (These Italian partners frequently
bid short diamond suits, for their one-
club opening is artificial, and their one-
notrump opening is very strong.)

However, the U.S. gained one 1MP

Nilsland could hardly open after tak-

Following the 14-16 notrump, Stayman
and reply, three diamonds was minor-
suit Stayman, implying slam interest.
Three spades showed four or five dia-
monds and at most three clubs. Fal-
lenius felt five clubs was a void or sin-
gleton, whereas Nilsland thought it had
to be a void, by a passed hand. —

After the inverted minor-suit raise,
Morten described a minimum with club
shortage. Three spades asked about that
suit; the reply showed either no spade
control or no aces. Four clubs asked
there; the answer showed either three
aces or a void in clubs with no aces.

cing with at least four spades in an un-
balanced hand. One notrump showed
4-7 points; two clubs announced both
majors; two diamonds was a relay; and
two hearts showed four-five. Three
clubs suggested the end of the line. Nil-
sland thinks his final pass was timid,
but that jack of clubs is a big card.

The Danes had a routine Acol auc-
tion. Morten couldn’t risk three no-
trump opposite unknown clubs.

BWS auction: The same as that pro-
duced by the Lund Madsen brothers.

Awards: 3 NT 9; 2 NT 6; 3 %5;2 9

Final score: Fallenius-Nilsland

The Swedes squeak out a close win.
But for Lars’ forgetfulness on Deal Six,
the Danes might have won. That would
have deprived the Swedes of their
fourth qualifying point. Next month’s
deals are on pages 5 and 12.

Here again I’m not sure whom to
charge. It seems to me that Avarelli
made a good bid, but, for all I know,
takeout doubles of one diamond with-
out any spades may be de rigueur in
the Roman Club System. I know that
editor Moyse believes in this sort of
thing, and I can only hope that he learns
from this horrible (and somewhat un-
lucky) example. Incidentally, the story
would have had a happy ending (for the
Italians) if [the redoubler] had taken out
to five clubs or five diamonds. It must
have been an authoritative double.

Forquet and Siniscalco were the an-
chor pair of the Italian team—they
played 144 of the 164 boards. And they
were an effective pair, though some-
what erratic. A few of their errors were
shameful—e.g., on Deal 69 they played
the hand in a cue bid, on this auction:

Siniscalco had the blank A-Q of dia-
monds, and Forquet had the blank 10-9.

. And there was Forquet’s incredible
auction on Deal 58. He held:

With both sides vulnerable, Sinis-
calco opened with one spade. Forquet
responded one notrump. Siniscalco re-
bid two spades. Forquet rebid two
notrump. Opener ran to three spades,
and, so help me, Forquet persisted with
three notrump, and went for 500. I
know a few players who bid like that,
but they are all either occasional club

to avoid another club loser. And this
defense was necessary, too. At the
other table D’Alelio was in five hearts
also (on his own steam, not pushed
there). Silodor led the ace of diamonds
and shifted to a spade. D’Alelio pulled
trumps, stripped out the spades and dia-
monds, and then end-played West in
clubs.

Boy, our gentler MSC is really going
to be a barrel of laughs; imagine all the
scores of 800. The good news is that
this month’s problems, other than this
clunker, have enough meat to them that
we don’t need to waste much space
here.

When we first played matchpoints,
we learned the principle that the spade
suit was key. Why in the world have we
chosen to bury it?

IRA RuBIN: “‘One heart. With limited
strength (albeit juicy spots), it’s doubtful
that you can get both suits in, so try to
inform partner as best you can.”

PHILLIP ALDER: “One heart. If my mi-
nors were reversed, I would probably opt
for one spade, aiming to show both suits,
but here we might well belong in dia-
monds.”’

SAMI KEHELA: “One heart. Awkward.
May lose the spade fit.”’

CARL HUDECEK: “One heart. I am tem-
porarily ignoring spades, with RHO prob-
ably four-four in the majors.”

This loss of spades rates to be more
than temporary. If you neglect to bid
the master suit now, the odds are high
that it’s gone forever. Yet, it doesn’t
bother our intrepid panel a whit.

AL Rotu: “‘One heart. I take no aggres-
sive action, and I hope to slow the bidding
down. If I bid two clubs, I might hear three
clubs from West and more clubs from East.
I will not get shut out after one heart.”

It is nice that you would like to slow
the auction down; however, one of your
opponents has mentioned a suit that
you seem to be lacking. This slow-

The six IMP difference I charged
mostly to Stone but a little to Roth.

What of Siniscalco and Forquet—did
I charge them for their terrible three
notrump contract? No, for it cost only
one IMP, and I had decided that swings
this small were beneath notice. But I
did put a “black mark”’ in their column
to indicate an unpunished error.

I have two other types of notations on
my books, both of which show up on

The play was the same at both tables.
Singleton club lead, ace winning. Dia-
mond finesse lost to the king; heart ten
to North’s ace. Two high clubs cashed,
then two spades and a ruff. Silodor was
down two, 100; Forquet was down
three, 500. The U.S. gained five IMP.
How should it be charged?

I can’t see why any of the Italians
should be faulted. Avarelli’s spade
overcall is reasonable; so is Bella-
donna’s pass over two diamonds. For-
quet’s opening at the other table is
sound, and while Siniscalco’s three-
diamond bid is questionable, I refuse to
charge it, for I probably would have bid
three diamonds myself—at IMP scor-
ing, nonvulnerable, with both oppo-

‘| nents passed hands.

Really, Roth and Stone created the
swing out of thin air—Stone, with his
third-hand pass and his courageous vul-
nerable three-level overcall; Roth, with
his pass over one diamond and his ex-
cellent penalty double of three dia-
monds.

So I gave Roth and Stone a credit of
five IMP. It is unfair to charge as errors
unusual bids or plays which fail, with-
out crediting “‘operations’’ which suc-
ceed. And, on the Italian side of the

for a splinter than a concentration in one
suit. There’s almost no chance that two
clubs will end the auction.”

MARK BARTUSEK: ““Two clubs. Assum-
ing that this doesn’t get passed out, I will
be able to complete a very accurate de-
scription of my hand on the next round;
partner can make the final competitive de-
cision. A four-diamond splinter would
overstate the strength of the hand and hide
the important club features. Also, I would
like a club lead if we defend against a
high-level diamond contract.”

Caravelli, Carruthers, Eisenberg,
Kokish, Lowenthal and Smith all be-
moaned the unavailability of a fit-
showing jump to four clubs. Although
we, too, prefer this gadget, we are much
too nice to complain.

Some preferred a four-diamond
splinter.

Mary & Max Harpy: “Four diamonds.
In our methods, we use concealed splin-
ters. Opener is able to distinguish between
a singleton and a void in responder’s hand,
but does not ask unless interested in a
slam—thus, there is no opening-lead blue-
print at game contracts.”’

A very nice convention, assuming
that you can convince your opponents
to remain silent.

MARSHALL MILES: “Four diamonds. I
wish I were slightly stronger, but partner
doesn’t need much for a slam if his hand
fits mine, especially if he has a singleton
spade.”

That is the problem with four dia-
monds. Although you are barely of
minimum strength, an attractive pattern
opposite (short spades, not short clubs)
is the key to this hand. Four diamonds,
two notrump and four hearts do nothing
to discover the solution of the spade-

The BRIDGE WORLD

club mystery. Additionally, we do not
like to splinter with all of our values in

one suit. We consider a typical splinter

42

to be more spread out. |

Several rejected four diamonds in fa-
vor of two notrump.

Cuip MARTEL: ““Two notrump. Better
hand for a fit-showing jump. However,
since neither that nor my own method
(where three clubs is a good four-card sin-
gle raise) is BWS, Ill settle for two
notrump (planning to drive to four hearts).
Four diamonds is a bit too much for me,
particularly since it gives partner no space
to wiggle.”

JEFF RUBENS: “Two notrump. It is easier
for West to double four diamonds than to
bid three diamonds. I have too high a de-
fense-to-offense ratio (with such weak
hearts) for a semi-psychic preempt.”’

Er1Ic RODWELL: ““Two notrump. Just
short of four diamonds. I want to save
space, in case partner is strong. Over three
clubs, I can jump to four diamonds.”’

Yes, at least the two-notrump bidders
have a chance of getting the auction to
go great for them.

Nineties-style bridge is more ob-
structionist than ever. If you want to be
known as a tough opponent, jump to the
maximum at every opportunity and
hope for the best. Most good bridge
players like to be thought of as difficult
opponents, so here we present the ma-
cho men.

MAHMOOD ZIA: “‘Four hearts. It’s hard
for them to bid five diamonds—even with
Six.’

IRA RUBIN: “‘Four hearts. If three clubs
were forcing, it might constitute a good
lead-director; however, it permits West to
get in rather cheaply. Hence, just leap to
four hearts (and don’t fret about North’s

As South, I hold no brief for my part-
ner’s three-notrump bid, although it
won the tournament for me. I had done
my darndest to scream that my hand
was worthless except at clubs. But there
I was at three notrump, a foul contract

To the “‘what happened and why”
type of tournament report, Edgar
brought fearless journalism. Prior to his
entry into this realm, even the pungent
criticisms of a Moyse were not directed
at players. Bidding philosophies, sys-
tems, approaches and myths were
blamed for failures during the auction;
partnership defense was treated simi-
larly when possible. Other writers were
even more restrained. For the less dis-
guisable individual errors in play and
defense, authors (even Moyse) some-
times retreated behind not naming the
player involved.

Every now and then, someone dared

West opened the heart queen, which
I won in dummy, East’s king falling. I
led the nine of clubs (not the seven) to
my king, and West put on the ace. West
shifted to a small diamond, and
dummy’s jack forced the ace. The dia-
mond return rode to dummy’s king.
Now I led the club seven from the table,
finessed my own eight, and made 10
tricks for a top. -

You see, I was lucky enough to have
Norman Kay on my left, in the West
position. Never in his life has Norman
been guilty of so bad a play as winning
the first club if he could hold up, so the
finesse was marked.

Obviously, the secret of winning In-
dividuals is to make sure that your op-
ponents are more expert than your part-
ners.

to say who had committed a howler
during the play. On these occasions, the
blow was usually softened by a not-so-
gentle reminder that the perpetrator was
well known as the best player in 40
counties in three different states, and
had enjoyed that status ever since a tot.

level will be too high to continue; if East
bids quietly, he probably has a ‘real’ two-
club opener and there will be little point in
bidding.”’

There would be little point in bidding
once opener has shown his hand, but
you might have tried the effect of bid-
ding just a tad more last round.

MICHAEL ROSENBERG: ““Two diamonds.
Keep it low. Maybe I'll get a chance to bid
three notrump, which will depict my hold-
ing fairly well. I have had bad experiences
preempting with hands such as this. (Of
course, I’ve also had bad experiences when
my opponents preempt.)”’

Wouldn’t it be nice to bid like that?
Three notrump not only warns them of
the club problem, it assures that if the
opponents play the contract your part-
ner will think that they saw his hand.

Of course you could start with four
diamonds.
AL RotuH: ‘Four diamonds. And, if

pass—pass—four hearts or four spades, I
will bid five clubs.”

Rosenberg’s opponents get to play
the hand double-dummy and double
him on the four level. Roth’s opponents
get to double him one level higher.

IRA RUBIN: ‘“‘Four diamonds. Only four
diamonds, as a bad split may wreak havoc
upon East. Besides, how will partner ever
figure out what to lead opposite your five-
diamond call, if LHO bids five spades and
RHO raises to slam.”’

It’s more likely that RHO will be de-
clarer, so that you will be on lead. Are
you contemplating fourth from your
longest and strongest?

ERIC RODWELL: “‘Four diamonds. Feels
right—should be a good save, invites part-
ner to raise with a fit, but leaves East-West
room to have an accident.”

oe

The BRIDGE WORLD

Yes, they do have plenty of room.

GERALD CARAVELLI: ‘“‘Four diamonds.
Pll bid as far as I’m willing to go. If East
is declarer, I’m on lead; if West declares a
slam, I can double (and hope).”’

HENRY BETHE: “‘Four diamonds. Looks
about right on loser count.”’

Maybe at a worse vulnerability.
Many of the three-diamond bidders
are also planning to bid again.

PAUL TRENT: “Three diamonds. I intend
to bid four clubs after pass—pass—three-
of-a-major.”’

DICK FREEMAN: “Three diamonds. I'll
probably follow with four notrump over

four of a major.”

44

You know what we think of those
plans, so we won’t kick a dead horse.

Cuip MARTEL: “Three diamonds. With
good defense, I won’t go crazy, but I am
willing to take some space and suggest a
save. I suppose three clubs is possible, but
I expect to be on lead.”’

JEFF RUBENS: ““Three diamonds. Bidding
two diamonds here suggests the need to
find a fit to compete. Pass is acceptable—
with no further information, I’d bet against
East-West’s being able to make their nor-
mal contract.”’

Yes, we agree. Pass has much more
chance of success than that lovely two-
diamond overcall.

PHILLIP ALDER: “‘Four diamonds. Often,
three clubs works with this type of hand,
but here I expect to be on lead (if we de-
fend), and they don’t rate to end in
notrump if left to themselves.”

That is the key point. They must be
50-1 to play in a major. Why give them
an easy ride?

MARSHALL MILEs: “Three diamonds. In
my youth, I would have bid two spades,
but I don’t need desperation tactics (or a

The last board concluded a remark-
able 50-imp spurt over five boards. On
the Vu-Graph, we noticed that Rosen-
berg intentionally delayed placing his
pass card on the tray after Chemla had
bid five clubs. This “‘screen huddling”’
is entirely ethical and proper. The
screen is supposed to conceal fast calls
as well as huddles; if a player makes a
fast call, his opponent may delay the
movement of the tray so that the speed
of the call is not known on the other
side of the screen. Whether this had any
effect on Perron’s losing decision to bid
the slam we will never know, but the
result was a fine one for the U. S. In the

The Tournament Scene

While the behavioral pot simmered
through the late ’50s and early ’60s, in
other dimensions tournaments kept
cooking in more or less the usual way.
To be sure, “‘usual’’ then was a bit dif-
ferent from “‘usual’’ now. For example,
in the age before fixed partnerships be-
came the norm in serious events, there
was some respect for individual con-
tests. Indeed, the Masters Invididual
was regarded as a premier event. And
the contest for winning the most master
points in a year (then called the
McKenney, now named after Barry
Crane) was regarded as significant,
both by the general public and by the

dramatic turnaround and gave the U. S.

Remembered, II

tournament crowd. Nowadays, each of
these areas enjoys only a small fraction
of its former status.

Among the top players, Edgar
Kaplan was one of the least capable in
individual events. (By far the most suc-
cessful stars in this universe were the
ones with the most placid personalities,
such as B. Jay Becker and Norman
Kay.) However, in 1957, when Edgar
won the McKenney trophy with what
was then considered an astronomical
masterpoint total (chicken feed in to-
day’s inflation-wracked economy), he
somehow won the Masters Individ-
ual—oops, I mean the Life Masters In-
dividual; even then, events had to be
reclassified to reduce the number of in-

═══════════════ PAGE 46 ═══════════════
four hearts. ... A grand is possible after a
follow-up exchange of cue-bids.”’

Before we choose between ‘a’ and
‘b,’ let’s hear from our two ‘c’s.

CARL HUDECEK: “‘c. Six diamonds. The
direct route to slam. If I had chosen a three-

spade advance, and partner then bid three
notrump, I would pass.”

If we had to make one bid for our
lives, we would choose six diamonds.
But why should we give up on seven,
easy to reach opposite many fitting
minimums? As to passing three no-
trump, anything we’d print would be
censored by the editor, so we had best
say nothing at all.

ARTHUR ROBINSON: “‘c. Four clubs. I as-
sume this is 100% forcing.”

Yes, we assume that. Too bad it has
nothing to do with your hand. Is this
some new system where new suits in
competition show voids?

Let’s get back to reality and see if we
should start with three hearts or three
spades. The three-spade bidders are try-
ing to paint a complete picture.

JEFF RUBENS: “b. Three spades, then
four hearts. Three hearts first is unlikely to
accomplish much. If I can get away with
three spades, my later cue-bids will support
diamonds and show, roughly, my hand pat-
tern.” |

Kir Woo sey: “‘b. Three spades, then
four hearts, then five diamonds (probably).
As I can’t show my club void conven-
iently, this sequence gives the best picture
of my hand.” |

They’re not bidding three spades to
try to get to spades, but simply to show
their shape. Sure, and they’ll get that
chance if partner bids three notrump.
The problem is that partner might end-

46

The BRIDGE WORLD

play them into a guess by raising to
four spades. We’d rather make sure
North knows we’re showing a monster
hand for diamonds while there’s still
room to investigate.

JOHN LOWENTHAL: “‘b. Three spades,
then five clubs. As in problem A, source of
tricks first, then splinters, cue-bids, etc. I
plan to drive to slam.”’

Not bad, but you’re lucky you had
room to splinter. If partner were unkind
enough to rebid four clubs (not really a
surprise), then where would you be?
You'd have a really hard time convinc-
ing him that you have enormous dia-
mond support.

Given South’s heart holding, it
should be a bit of a surprise that North
bids three notrump. Without knowing
partner’s rebid, it seems that we should
make sure we do everything we can to
announce our diamonds.

Curip MARTEL: ‘“‘a. Three hearts, then
four hearts. Should show the ace (with a
singleton, I’d probably bid four hearts di-
rectly). Slam prospects are too good to bid
anything but a slam try in diamonds.”

Chip then went on to discuss the mer-
its of four spades as a fit bid, but he
didn’t like the fact that it took up so
much room. We’d rather not make a fit
bid with a side void and a side ace.
Something like,

AKQxxx YVxx OKQXx &xx,
is more typical.

RON GERARD: “‘a. Three hearts, then four
diamonds. Clearest slam try. Three spades
looks like standard rubber bridge perver-
sity...”

Or maybe matchpoint perversity.

Sure, that fifth heart and useful spade
holding were good catches, so maybe
the layout was an aberration, and the
long-run winner really is:

Bossy WOLFF: “‘Pass. I think pass is the

percentage call. Game is remote, and a plus
score is probable versus one spade.”

DICK FREEMAN: “‘Pass. Take my prob-

able plus. Partner doesn’t have four hearts ©

and six-plus points. So game is unlikely,
and we could head for a minus in competi-
tion.”

IRA RuBIN: “Pass. I’d opt for pass, al-
though two hearts might work if you catch
partner with many hearts but few high
cards (and probably long clubs).”’

AL ROTH (and PHILLIP ALDER similarly):
“Pass. I hope we reap a profit. I don’t

believe we have a game unless West psy-
ched.”’

They get 90 points here, not 100,
since the inclination of the panel (18 to
14) was to balance and hope there
might be a game. Any of you passers
that want to send a letter of complaint
should be happy that this isn’t Roth’s
‘At the Table”’ column. In that format
you would get a small skinny zero,
since 620 happened to be par on the
actual deal. Accept your 90 points and
have a nice day.

HENRY BETHE (and CARL HUDECEK simi-
larly): ‘“‘Pass. Where’s the future opposite a
passing partner?”’

The future could be slam on little

The BRIDGE WORLD

more than a finesse opposite:
AKx Yxxxxxx Oxx &xxx.

The South hand is special because
the hearts are ace-king-fourth, instead
of, say, king-queen-jack-fourth. With
our holding, if we catch partner with
heart length, we know the combination
will play like a dream. The clubs are
ruffed with our low trumps, and the
ace-king draw the opponents’. With
king-queen-jack-fourth of hearts, things
would be messier.

ERIC KOKISH: “‘Pass. One notrump is the
only alternative, and it’s not unreasonable
at this vulnerability at IMPs. Still, I think
it’s odds-against to make three notrump
opposite likely club-spade length, so let’s
try to go plus on defense.”’

Cup MARTEL: “‘Pass. When you have no
good bid and length in the opponent’s suit,
it’s usually best to pass. While you could,
of course, be cold for four hearts, it is un-
likely you will bid it with confidence any-
way.”

JEFF RUBENS: “‘Pass. Game our way is
unlikely, I have no comfortable action any-
way (one notrump?!), and spades is likely
to be a good trump suit for us.”

MICHAEL ROSENBERG: “‘Pass.:. . . I be-
lieve game is very unlikely, and bidding
(presumably one notrump) will turn a plus
into a minus more often than vice-versa.”

Okay, okay. Those are reasonable ar-
guments, but so are:

GERALD CARAVELLI: “‘Double. No rea-
son to assume that one spade is the optimal
spot for our side or that it is not for them.”

STEVE WEINSTEIN: “‘Double. The most
likely game is four hearts. Partner’s most
likely bid is two clubs, over which I will
bid two hearts and hope he gets the mes-
sage. [If we doubled and removed to two

GERALD CARAVELLI: “Fl. No. I would
have made a negative double. Why not?”

Rosenberg, Smith, and Woolsey all
would double because their singleton is
in the opponents’ suit.

Kokish doubles because he’s afraid
partner will have some diamond length
and won’t be able to reopen with a dou-
ble. Lowenthal prefers double, but is
afraid of minus 470. Martel doubles,
but can live with pass.

MARK BARTUSEK: “Fl. Yes. I would
pass over three diamonds because a nega-
tive double would most likely fetch a
three-notrump bid or a penalty pass from
partner, neither of which I would enjoy. I
admit there are times when we will miss a
game, but it seems too risky in the long run
to double.”’

We remain unconvinced either way.
Let’s now look at the spicier comments
on F 1.

IRA RuBIN: ““F1. No. Double is manda-
tory, and pass is purgatory.”

RON GERARD: “Fl. No. . . . Partner
won’t leave in a double except in months
divisible by four.”

Is that a shot at us? Last time we
checked, January wasn’t divisible by
four, so we wonder if his attack is di-
rected towards our April/August/De-
cember guy, Mr. Woolsey. Nah, it’s
probably aimed at us. But what’s so bad
if partner leaves in our negative dou-
ble? We have an ace and a doubleton in
his suit to lead. We’d be more nervous
with a third club, which could crash his
potential club tricks. Contrary to popu-
lar belief, we don’t go out of our way to
pass partner’s “‘takeout”’ doubles.

F2 is also fairly simple. Can partner
have a good balanced hand? Of course.

The BRIDGE WORLD

What is he to do? The fact that you
passed three diamonds makes it un-
likely that you’ll pull on the five level,
so it is very attractive for opener to
double with a “‘penalty”’ type of hand.

MARK BARTUSEK (and eight others sim-
nilarly): ““Yes, with a two-notrump rebid;
what else can he do?”’

The only comment we received from
a ““No”’ voter was,

JEFF RUBENS: “‘F2. No. It’s a takeout
double. Sometimes, you have to make a
penalty pass over a preempt to avoid over-
encouraging partner to bid.”

He seems to be comparing this situ-
ation to one where your opponent
opens four hearts, and you have ace-
queen-jack-nine of hearts but can’t
double because you “‘know’”’ partner is
pulling. This surely is not the same cir-
cumstance.

Gerard and Kokish think North can
be 3=3=2=5, and mention Total Tricks.
Eric says that North will expect South
to take out the double only with ex-
treme shape.

JOHN CARRUTHERS: “‘F2. Sure. What else

is the poor sap supposed to do with,

AAKIYKI1I0 Oxx &AKxxx?

Pass? Is that forcing to double? Only if
you’re EOK at unfavorable. Looks like a
Law problem to me, boys. We have at most
9, they have, say, 11 (although perhaps it’s
10 and 12).”

More on that, when we get to F3.

GERALD CARAVELLI: “‘F2. Yes. Certainly
partner could be 3=3=2=5, although I have
partners who say that you have to pass with
good balanced hands because all these
doubles are for takeout. [Maybe one of
them is Rubens.—D.B. & L.C.] That is los-

Two spades was artificial, showing
the values for a four-heart bid. The lead
of the jack of hearts gave dummy some
entries, but nonetheless things looked
grim for declarer. I thought his best bet
was to float the eight of diamonds,
playing South for the nine and North
for the ace-king. That lie would permit
the eventual discard of clubs after tak-
ing a ruffing finesse in diamonds.

Zia did better. He played a heart to
dummy (Perron discarding the seven of
clubs, showing count), and ran the
queen of diamonds to South’s ace.
Chemla had a problem, and eventually
shifted to a club, handing Zia the con-
tract. Perhaps Perron should have
worked out to rise with the king of dia-
monds and protect his partner from this
situation, but that is a difficult play to
find at the table. The board was a wash-

This is one of the most complex deals
I have ever tried to analyze. There are
several possible approaches for de-
clarer. Chemla led the ace of clubs. Af-
ter some thought, Zia tried what seems
to be an unfortunate line. He ruffed the
club, played a diamond to the king,
took a spade finesse, cashed the ace of
diamonds, and ruffed a diamond low.
Chemla overruffed and returned a
trump. It might seem as though Zia can
make the contract by ducking, but a
spade return from North would leave
declarer a trick short. In practice, Zia
won with dummy’s ace of hearts and
went into a long huddle. We in the
audience worked out that the contract
could be made by ruffing a diamond

right about partner’s being very short in
diamonds with a good hand, we could so
easily have a slam in either of two strains.
Hence, my kamikaze cue-bid. Of course, I
will have to tell partner that I was asleep on
the first round. Passing and then driving to
a slam is hardly consistent.”

At least he knocks his action (about
three times) in his comments.

Our editor always tells us to be brief
and to try to condense comments so
that The Bridge World can afford to
publish. It wasn’t easy on this problem,
with its three different questions and
lots of confused panelists trying to an-

been much simpler for us if everyone
used this approach:

Moyse would say, ““Throw this hand

diamonds should take up a new game.”
Still bidding as if it’s 1956:

PAUL TRENT: “‘Abstain. I bid two dia-
monds over one spade.”’

Come on guy, what’s up? Surely the
forcing notrump should not keep you
from being able to play bridge. These
problems don’t always feature our pre-
ferred methods, but that doesn’t mean
we can’t have them imposed on us in a
bidding panel. On Problem B, we (with
many others) wanted to bid four clubs,
fit, but BWS, wrongly in our opinion,
plays that as a splinter. Still, that’s not
a reason to abstain.

RON GERARD: “‘Three hearts. Consistent
with one notrump, but what would I have
done over two diamonds? If you don’t
raise hearts, you’re substituting slogans for
common sense. These are the hands where
forcing notrump shows the worst, since
partner would comfortably bid game with,

Give me an old-fashioned, honest two-dia-
mond response any time. Could three
hearts be unanimous? Nah, someone will
commit four hearts, two spades (shudder)
or two notrump (yuk).”’

He might not like the forcing
notrump, but at least he enlightened us,
as usual, with words of wit. Let’s see
about some of those shudders and yuks.

First, the yuks.

MAryY & MAX HArpy: ““Two notrump.
If we play here, we’re odds on. Would
prefer a club stopper, but perfection often
eludes.”

Kit Woo sey: ““T'wo notrump. A diffi-
cult problem, as every action has clear
flaws. This call is right on strength, and if
partner is five-five in the majors he can
rebid three hearts. If he passes or bids three

four-card major is that your partner will
play you for five and over-compete.
This happened on Board 8 as Rosen-
berg, holding,

made a losing decision to reraise to
three spades after he had raised one
spade to two and his RHO had re-

defeated three spades, which was only a
four-four fit, and three clubs had been
headed for defeat. Fortunately for the
U. S., the French unaccountably over-
bid to four spades, down one; a push.

Rosenberg led the jack of clubs; Zia

surprised that declarer didn’t duck the

put even more pressure on Rosenberg
to find safe discards. Guided by Zia’s

order of play in clubs (with spade
strength, Zia would have played king-
then-queen), Rosenberg discarded a
heart. Chemla cashed ace of diamonds
and ace-king of spades, then led a dia-
mond. Had he known that diamonds
were four-one, he would have ducked;
not knowing, he went up with dummy’s
king and was in trouble. Having no
other hope, declarer continued with the
queen and another diamond. East care-
lessly kept his remaining spade. This
convinced Rosenberg that declarer had
a third spade, and, as we American
rooters watched in horror, Rosenberg
played a spade, giving declarer the con-
tract. This was a big swing, as the U. S.
stopped safely in three diamonds.

On Board 10, Zia, with jack-seven of
clubs in the closed hand opposite king-
eight-six-four in dummy, announced a
claim that included a statement that he
would play his LHO for the ace of
clubs. LHO’s actual holding was sin-
gleton ace. I was curious about what the
ruling might have been if the defender
had happened to hold the singleton
queen of clubs. Would declarer have
been assumed to have led a low club
toward the king, or could he be forced
to lead the jack after the claim?

After an opening low-spade lead, I
was afraid that Chemla might try the
jack of hearts and crash 100 honors,
but, instead, he passed the six of hearts.
Zia won and returned a spade, West
winning. Now, Rosenberg decided that
cashing more spades would put Zia un-
der too much pressure; so, he shifted to
a low diamond. Chemla ducked the
king of diamonds and won the diamond
continuation, Rosenberg retaining his
queen. When declarer led the jack of
hearts, covered by the queen and ace, it
looked to me as though Chemla could
count out Rosenberg’s hand, cash the
ace of clubs, and endplay him with the
third spade for down one. In fact, de-
clarer did cash the ace of clubs, but then
he continued with the queen. There
were some very nervous moments as
Zia considered ducking this trick,
which would have allowed declarer to
revert to the endplay. At last, Zia won

Expanded Content; More Bonuses

This month, we continue our replace-
ment of the wrapper that previously oc-
cupied the magazine’s outermost four
sides. You will notice an increase in
each issue’s editorial content—more
pages of features and departments. We
are counting on technology to eliminate
the potential downside of this change.

dures will reduce the number of times
the post office puts your copy through a
sorting machine or human hands. The
Bridge World should arrive in better
condition. We request guidance on one
matter related to the wrapper project.
Should the Bridge World Standard
Summary (two pages) appear once or
twice each year? If it matters to you,
write either ““BWS1”’ or “BWS2” on
any piece of correspondence.

You may have noticed another im-
provement, one that may be the most
popular of all: Our cover has become
more colorful. If you like that half as
much as we do, you’ll be delighted. We
admit there is one tiny problem with
adding color, increasing content, buy-
ing new computers, enlarging the staff,
and upgrading services: How are we
going to pay for it? Our plan is to pro-
duce a very large increase in the sub-
scription list. That’s where you come
in. Please tell your bridge friends about
the new, larger, more colorful Bridge
World; promote our Internet site:
www.bridgeworld.com. Send us the
name and address of a potential sub-
scriber—we’ll send a sample issue and
mention your name. Give gift subscrip-
tions: Your recipients will think kindly
of you every month, and if your part-
ners read the magazine you will profit
directly at the table. To promote gift-
giving, the traditional bonus offer has
been made more generous. For each
gift you give, you will get a book for
yourself. (See inside back cover.)

Are we giving you the impression
that we are trying harder? Can you sug-
gest other ways in which we can im-
prove? Please let us know.

Six spades by South —_ Lead: Club queen

Suppose you play trumps early, tak-
ing two rounds after winning the open-
ing lead. If spades turn out to be four-
one, you are in trouble. If you switch to
hearts, the defender with four trumps
may be able to ruff in and lead a trump,
leaving you a trick short. Alternatively,
if you take two club ruffs after the sec-
ond trump you will still face a di-
lemma: when you lead a fourth round
of trumps, the long-trump defender
may have another club; should you in-
stead try hearts, the third round may be
ruffed, cutting you off from the pitch
for your diamond loser.

A superior plan is to duck a trump at

Editorial

Ring in the New

Along with 1998, we welcome to
The Bridge World staff Associate Edi-
tor Phillip Alder. An Englishman by
birth who now lives in Florida, he
brings outstanding credentials to his
new position: one of the world’s lead-
ing syndicated columnists, author or
co-author of successful books in sev-
eral areas of bridge, and a former editor
of Bridge Magazine. Some of his arti-
cles have appeared in our pages.

Phillip’s main area of responsibility
will be Challenge the Champs, where
he recently appeared as a contestant.
Subscribers have had to read (suffer?)
the views of Kaplan and Rubens in this
column for thirty years; it’s high time
they were given the opportunity to en-
dure a different set of biases. The be-
ginning of Alder’s tenure also marks a
change in the editorial policy governing
the department: To increase the rele-
vance of the descriptions for most read-
ers, the text for each deal will include a
possible approach to the auction using
Bridge World Standard. In most cases,
a third (“‘standard’’) auction, or begin-
ning of an auction, will be presented.
This adjustment will hold sway during
a trial period, while readers’ comments
are evaluated.

The new year will also usher in mi-

nor changes in the Master Solvers’

Club, where we are dropping several
not-too-popular statistics: the “‘Solvers’
Percentage,” for which it is too difficult
to obtain anything near a random sam-

ple while maintaining the magazine’s
production schedule; the ‘Experts’
Honor Roll,”’ the purpose of which con-
tinues to be misinterpreted despite re-
peated in-print explanations; and, cor-
respondingly, the Experts’ and Solvers’
averages.

This issue marks the first absence of
Rate Your Own Game in over 25 years.
The editor has nostalgic feelings about
this column, but only a handful of read-
ers bewailed its pending departure, pro-
posed in September. To avoid closing
the door too firmly, we will if possible
include an occasional article of this
type in response to suggestions to pre-
sent an idea or area of bidding not al-
ready covered by the department.

To make way for other series, the
Swiss Match scheduled for this issue
has been postponed. Our current expec-
tation is that it will appear in the April
issue.

New Location; New Facilities

The Bridge World has relocated to
the suburbs, moving out of Manhattan
for the first time in its almost-seventy-
year history. Our new address is 717
White Plains Road, Suite 106, Scars-
dale, NY 10583-5009. There is no ac-
commodation for walk-in ordering or
purchasing there; nonetheless, we in-
tend to improve our level of service
dramatically—aiming at that achieved
when the late Betty Kaplan ran the of-
fice, a very high goal indeed—in part

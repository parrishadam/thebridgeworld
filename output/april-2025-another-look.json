East correctly let the club queen hold, so that dummy would lack sufficient entries to bring in the long clubs.\n\nI returned to the closed hand with a diamond to lead a second club.

Now, with another look over 65 years later, I notice that I made a second mistake. Do you see it?\n\nI should have ducked the spade jack. If it had held the trick, I could have continued with a club, discarding my remaining diamond. Then, if East had started with ace-eight-four-deuce of spades, the contract would have succeeded (where the approach I took at the table would have failed)."

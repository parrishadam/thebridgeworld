The book begins with and throughout emphasizes the critical connection area at the arca of ana-lyzing how to handle individual suit holdings; distinguishing between the abstract correct play in isolation and the appropriate handling in the context of appropriate hands and the tradesoffs among ing stries and the tradesoffs among themes, to create awareness of the oppor-tunities for objective tactics other handed well, especially in the 36 quiz deals that augment the lessons and nu-merous individual suit discussions. The tactical level is elementary to low inter-mediate, but more of the quiz deals stretch to greater challenges. Overall, the book is good, but we cannot give it our highest recommendation because the authors' goaf in a few places, messag-ing to set up an occasional analyst's whitle tryg-sympathize; we've been there our-selves.\n\njust the sort of knowledge one needs to advance from formula follower to intel-ligent bidder.

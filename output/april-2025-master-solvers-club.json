Opener may have four spades, and East-West will wind up in spades.\"\n\nBart and David prefer to have this redouble show values and exactly two hearts; Steve uses a similar treatment; other panelists mentioned its popularity.

A not-unlikely six=four in the red suits with North may yield a game, e.g.:\n\n♠ Q x ♥ A Q J x x x ♦ Q 10 x x ♣ x.\n\nI am also optimistic about our defensive prospects. At any scoring, but especially vulnerable at imps, a minimal overcall tends to be based on at least a good suit and an entry, e.g.:\n\n♠ x x ♥ A J 10 x x ♦ A x x ♣ 10 x x.\"\n\nJOHN DIAMOND: \"Redouble. It's more likely that partner has six hearts than three spades (especially as the auction suggests that he lacks extras). This is a chance to show a doubleton heart with values. BWS does not say this explicitly, but one should not redouble with a singleton.\"\n\nRight. The focus should be on hearts, and we want to encourage partner to rebid the suit with six."

The right sort of hand for the two-trump raise: extra high cards, possible double fit (based on high diamonds).\"\n\nAs we know, raising on a doubleton is an invitation for partner to over-compete. Sometimes, such a raise might be necessary, but that doesn't apply here.\n\nDANNY KLEINMAN: \"Pass. Fit, fit, who has a fit? Perhaps nobody. If I were required to guess, I'd say that the deal belongs to us in two hearts, but I suspect that a better score may be available on defense. If the opponents stay out of trouble and land in two clubs, I will bid two hearts. I do not view delayed raises as showing weakness. Rather, I consider that they show better hands in high cards than direct raises and holdings well-suited for defense.\"\n\nI don't see it. Even if there is no great fit, this could easily be North-South's deal. Defending at a low level when our side has at least a decent seven-card fit in a higher-ranking suit is not the way to win imps."

Not only might it kill dummy, but we might obtain a diamond ruff. However, if declarer has a singleton diamond, the lead might not be necessary, since we can lead a diamond when in with the ace of spades. The danger of giving declarer a quick discard is quite real, and if East is void of diamonds, a diamond lead could be a disaster.\n\nIf we are leading another side suit, which is better?\n\nDaniel Korbel: \"Club four. I have no idea. Any suit could be right.\"\n\nJeff Rubens: \"Club four. Not a diamond, fearing that dummy has eight and partner, with ace-low (or two low to declarer's singleton ace), will think (at trick two or later) that I led a singleton.\"\n\nBrian Glubok: \"Club deuce. Since I lack a diamond honor, that suit is possible. I used to prefer a low heart in situations such as this, but a book about simulations of leads suggested otherwise. I lead a low club so that partner won't read me for a doubleton.\"\n\nIt is usually safer to lead away from nothing than from an honor, but with dummy short of entries, that might not be the case here. A heart lead has the advantage of doing good things if it hits partner's strength."

I usually make an attacking lead on this type of auction. I need less from North in hearts than in clubs.\"\n\nLarry Robbins: \"Heart six. The ace of trumps would enable seeing a suit-preference signal. A low trump might win, as dummy could have a ruffing value (even with only one spade). However, it feels as if we must take our tricks, or at least set up a heart trick (or two), and I would need much more from partner in clubs than in hearts.\"\n\nFinn Kolesnik: \"Heart six. It looks as if the opponents have a strong, long suit, so let's lead aggressively.\"\n\nDanny Kleinman: \"Heart six. Let's get our tricks before declarer can draw trumps and run diamonds.\"\n\nRozanne and Bill Pollack: \"Heart six. A diamond lead could cut off dummy or be disastrous when declarer is void.

A heart might yield two quick heart tricks, the spade ace, and another black-suit trick. The heart king could be better than the six in certain situations but very wrong if partner overtakes to return the suit.\"\n\nThere is one other possibility:\n\nJohn Carruthers: \"Spade ace. 'To find out what I should have led.'—Edwin B.\"\n\nHoward Weinstein: \"Spade ace. Maybe this will prevent a ruff in dummy. It will also allow me to see dummy and keep the lead, though probably I still won't know what to do.\"\n\nLeading a trump could be right, but it could be a calamity. The lost tempo could be fatal. Other leads might not blow a trick even when hitting a bad holding in the suit led. If a trump lead hits a bad holding, there will be no recovery.\n\n*\n\nThanks to Rick Roeder, La Mesa, CA, for Problem E; and to Ercan Cem, Istanbul, for Problem H."

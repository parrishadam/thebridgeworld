However, if five clubs is logically a club void with big diamonds (as a fine partnership should agree it is, by a passed hand) then change my vote.\"\n\nHe's also not driving to slam, and we feel that he'd lose in committee if he bid five clubs and then acted over a slow five diamonds. As to changing his vote, we can't. Yes, five clubs probably would show the hand he suggests, but it's not part of BWS.\n\nMICHAEL ROSENBERG: \"a. Three hearts, then five clubs. Partner should recognize this as a splinter [See Zia, above!—D.B. & L.C.]. Of course, it was very lucky that partner bid three notrump.\"\n\nJOHN CARRUTHERS: \"a. Three hearts, then four hearts.

Even though I 'know' partner's reaction to three spades, at the table I'm sure I would start with three hearts. Then, over three notrump, it seems natural to mention my diamond support and await partner's next move.\"\n\nWe always like honest problem D voters. Yes, if we had a wire that partner's next call would be a space-saving three notrump, we too might opt for three spades.\n\nSTEVE WEINSTEIN: \"a. Three hearts, then four diamonds. If I get by the next round, this round should be okay.\"\n\nPlease leave the Rothisms to Roth. There was no comment from Kantar, but he scored 50 points (a, four clubs) to bring his total to 260."

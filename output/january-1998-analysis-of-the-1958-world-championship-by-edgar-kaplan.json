The swings were due to judgment, rarely to system.\n\nOver the long match luck was fairly evenly, The Americans lost, on my reckoning, 51 IMP through unlucky swings, oming, 51 IMP through unlucky swings, They gained 44 IMP in lucky ones (By overcalls or underbids).\n\nSlam bidding was the worst department for both teams. The U.S. bid twelve slams—five made, seven went down. We missed four good slams that not enough to make the difference.\n\nWe lost because we were outplayed, We lost because we were outplayed; the Italians did a few more good things than we did, but a lot more bad things.
